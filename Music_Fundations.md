# Proposed Music Program

### Dr Matthew Field’s Innovative Program Music FUNdations ©

## Proposed for 2016

We plan to commence in Term 1 a weekly Music FUNdations©  course, principally for children aged 6+ (but suitable for adults also).

These low-cost music lessons introduce children to the foundations of music in a fun and progressive way and then introduce them to piano, guitar and violin.

To plan for the course we are holding two FREE information nights for parents on the following dates:

Tuesday November 24th 7.30pm

and

Saturday December 5th at 7.30pm

These sessions will be held at 1 High Street Road: entry is from street parking in High Street (refer Location details).

For further information about Dr Field’s program please visit his MusicProgram website.

To book for one of the information sessions please email pastor@ashburtonpc.org.au with your name and your preferred date. Please also include a phone number for contact in case of over bookings.
