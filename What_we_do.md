## What We Do

### Ashburton Presbyterian Church .

We seek to learn together, support one another, and jointly take the good news about Jesus to our community. As a church, we seek to balance what we do between nurturing and growing believers in their faith and sharing our faith with those who don't know Jesus.

We do not seek to be a 'one-stop shop' for everything spiritual, rather, we believe:

as followers of Jesus we should not be consumers of services, but producers, active in serving Christ (and each other) with our spiritual gifts and natural talents.
the church is organic - Paul depicts it as a 'body' of people with differing gifts and Jesus as the Head; Jesus pictures us as branches that have spiritual life by being connected to the vine. In the composition of the church at any point in time, God determines the gifts that are present. This means that our approach is not to establish a set of 'must-have' ministries and seek people to fill job descriptions, but rather to focus ministry on using the gifts of the people God has put in the church at the time.
ministries are best developed from the ground up, not from the top down. We encourage people to pursue their passion, gifting and the sense of call from God in establishing and undertaking ministries. Our ESL ministry is the result of such an approach. At the same time, the elders ensure that the ministries are consistent with the church's vision under the leading of the Holy Spirit, and are periodically reviewed against our goals.
At present, church life is organised around...
