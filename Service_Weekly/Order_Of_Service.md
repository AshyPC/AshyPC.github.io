Conclusion



Opening Prayer (Jeremiah 23:5)
5 “The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the Only God – the One Who keeps His promises, and fulfills His Word. We thank You that Jeremiah could take courage that the sadness of the people of God suffering judgement in exile for their sins was to be replaced by the King Who was to come and rule wisely and justly in the land.
We thank You for the coming of Jesus, and we prepare to celebrate His first coming which was in a quiet out-of-the-way place, as a baby born in a stable, not in a king’s palace. We have gathered today to worship, to pray and to hear and obey Your Word.
We also look forward to His return, in power and visible majesty to take up His Kingdom and rule for ever and ever.
In Jesus Mighty Name we pray, Amen.
