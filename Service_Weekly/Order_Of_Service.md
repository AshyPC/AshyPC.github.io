Conclusion


Jude vv20-21
[20] But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
[21] keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
Let us pray:
Heavenly Father, we gather here weekly to build ourselves up in the faith, by receiving encouragement from one another, by reading and hearing Your Word and by applying ourselves to the faithful teaching we receive.
We thank You for Your immeasurable mercy and love, expressed in Jesus, Who died that we might be pardoned and freed from sin, and Who rose again to grant us eternal life. We thank You for the faith that enables us to stand against the wiles of the enemy, trusting the Holy Spirit to provide a way of escape from the temptations that so easily beset us.
We pray for courage in these difficult times, when Your church is attacked by so many who oppose the Good News. As we gather today, we pray that we may grow stronger in faith as we see the examples of Your people in the past – either bad to be avoided, or good to be followed.
In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
