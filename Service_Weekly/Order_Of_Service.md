Conclusion


Opening Prayer (Psalm 107:1-3)
[1] Oh give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His steadfast love endures forever!
[2] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has redeemed from trouble
[3] and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are perfectly GOOD, and Your love remains steadfast towards Your redeemed people.
We thank You that we are a part of Your gathered people, even though we are far to the south – a long way from Jerusalem and the promised land. Yet by Your grace You have brought us near, so that we can know our greatest need and Your great salvation.
We thank You that we can freely gather as the redeemed of the Lord, to declare Your love, Your mercy, Your wisdom and Your sovereign power.
We ask that by Your Holy Spirit we may give You true honour as we hear and read Your Word, as we bring our petitions before You, as we submit to the teaching and preaching of Your servant Chris, and as we encourage one another in fellowship together. May we lift up the Name of Jesus and enthrone Him on our praises today.
In His Mighty Name we pray, Amen.
[Our God Is For Us]
