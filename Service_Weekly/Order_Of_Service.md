Conclusion



Opening Prayer (Isaiah 57:14-15)
[14] And it shall be said, “Build up, build up, prepare the way, remove every obstruction from my people’s way.” 
[15] For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, and to revive the heart of the contrite.”

Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are High and Lifted Up, inhabiting Eternity. We are low and look up to You Who are Awesome in Holiness. In ourselves we cannot enter Your Presence because of sin. Yet You have made a way for us, You have removed the Obstacle to us enjoying fellowship with You.
We thank You that Jesus showed us Your love and grace by coming from Your Presence on high and becoming one of us in our lowly state.
We thank You that You have revived our spirits by making the Way for us to return to You, even though we were enemies who had turned away by our own sin. We confess that we are still not perfect as You are Perfect, but we submit to Your discipline and instruction, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
We thank You that today we look afresh at what Your Word tells us of Jesus’ first coming, which we will soon celebrate at Christmas time. 
We commit this appointed time to You, especially so that we may praise and worship You, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
In Jesus Mighty Name we pray, Amen.
