Conclusion


Call to Worship (Psalm 30:4-5) & Opening prayer 
[4] Sing praise to the Lord, you His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy Name.
[5] For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime;
Let us pray…
Heavenly Father, we have come into Your house to bring our praises, and to give thanks for Your great grace to us.
We thank You for Your favour in saving us through Jesus going to the Cross and then rising again.
We thank You that Your anger is for just a moment, because sin has been dealt with and the accuser of the brethren is defeated.
We thank You that we are now free to sing from changed hearts and to honour Jesus as our King of kings.
Be with us by the Holy Spirit, we pray, as we submit to Your Word, and as we bring our praises today,
In Jesus Mighty Name we pray, Amen.
[Crown Him with Many Crowns]
