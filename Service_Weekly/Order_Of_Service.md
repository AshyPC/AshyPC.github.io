Conclusion



Opening prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)
16 Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 
Father God, we have gathered together today because we have a real reason to rejoice, for we celebrate Jesus, God the Son, Who is eternally with You, outside of time, but Who came into this world as a baby, to live as we do and then to take the penalty for our sinfulness by dying on the Cross.
We give You thanks that death could not hold Him, for He rose to eternal life again on the third day, and has given us His righteousness, so that we may live free of the burden of sin.
We thank You that You called us back to Yourself so that we can have real fellowship with You Who made us as relating people, not as isolated individuals.
We thank You that we may approach the throne of grace whenever we are in need (which is all the time). Jesus our eternal High Priest speaks for us, so that we can pray and be heard.
So we commit this time of praise, worship, prayer, reading of Your Word and fellowship with one another, so that Jesus may be lifted up and His Name be magnified among us today. In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
Let us now stand to Rejoice in the words of our first song:
 Joy to the World, the Lord is Come
