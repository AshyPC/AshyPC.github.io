Conclusion

‭**Call to Worship - Psalm 5:11-12**
*11 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.*
*12 For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover him with favour as with a shield.*

O Lord our God, we come today wanting to rejoice in You, and to thank You for Your protection. 
We acknowledge our lowly, sinful condition, and we humbly accept Your grace and mercy in forgiving our sin because Jesus has paid the full price of our redemption.
We thank You for having bestowed upon us the righteousness of Jesus in exchange for our self-righteousness, so that we are free to come before You now in praise.
May all we do and say here today be to His honour and glory, Amen.
