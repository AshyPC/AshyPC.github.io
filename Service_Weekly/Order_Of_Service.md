Conclusion

Call to Worship (Isaiah 46:9-10) & Opening prayer 
[9] Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,
[10] Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, ‘My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure’

Let us pray…
Heavenly Father, we come before You with thanks for Your great grace to us expressed in Jesus sacrifice, saving us from our sin, from its chains and from the guilt we know for offending You by turning away. We thank You that He paid the penalty and took away our self-righteous “filthy rags”, giving us His perfect righteousness in their place.
We have gathered today with purpose – to glorify Your Name and to submit our daily lives afresh to the authority of Your Eternal Word.
We pray that by Your Holy Spirit we can sing to Your glory from joyful hearts today, that we can take in Your word as we pay attention to the preaching, that we can say “Amen” to the prayers that are offered. And we pray that what we hear from Your Word will stay with us and change how we live so that we are more and more like Jesus, wherever we go and whomever we meet in the coming days.
In His Holy Name we pray, Amen.

[To God Be The Glory]
