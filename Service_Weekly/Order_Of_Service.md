Hosea 6:3

_he will come to us as the showers,_
    _as the spring rains that water the earth.”_
    
Heavenly Father we come together today to honour You as our Sovereign Lord, to lift up the Name of Jesus, the Saviour of Your people, and to glorify the Holy Spirit, Comforter and Guide as we walk this earthly pilgrimage.
We also come to hear Your Word read and preached, so that we may know You Father Son and Holy Spirit more and better than when we arrived.
We pray that we may know Your refreshing, Your gracious love and Your boundless mercy. In Jesus Name, Amen.

[Love Divine, All Loves Excelling]

Margaret Sanders
1 Timothy 5:17
_Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in preaching and teaching._

Today we want to honour Margaret Sanders as a faithful and persevering elder of the church for much longer than I have been a member here. I have been so blessed to work with Margaret and the late Wally French and learned so much from them about steady, faithful service in the Kingdom. The Session has promoted Margaret to the status of “Emeritus” so that she may enjoy the privileges of eldership without having to worry about the responsibilities. I confess that I was shocked by the fact that Margaret had her fall late last year and was in hospital for quite a while.
We are so glad for the answered prayer for her recovery, so I am going to ask Mook to present the double honour in our expression of love and concern for Margaret, and he will lead us in prayer.
