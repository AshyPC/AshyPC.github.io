## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 13th August 2017

__Job 14:7-9__ _"For there is hope for a tree, when it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail. ... at the scent of water it will flourish and put forth sprigs like a plant._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord God Almighty, You are the Source of all life, and we thank You that in Your ever-living Word we find true hope. Whatever the visible situation, where there is life there is hope, as both Job and King David knew. We therefore turn to You and away from a world which wants to give up on some people before their time. 

We come before You knowing that we can be influenced by the world's ways. We know we need One Who can save us from our own weaknesses and therefore we turn to Jesus, the only One Who has lived a perfect life. We thank You that You provided the Perfect Substitute Who has taken our place, and freed us from the guilt the power and the penalty of sin.

### The World and the Church
We thank You that our redemption is secure, even if we live in difficult times, when sharing Good News seems almost impossible. We thank You that Your Word is fixed forever in the heavens, and that we are still free to study it, apply it to our daily living, and share it with others. We pray for those even in Australia who cannot do so. We especially lift up to You Campbell Markham and David Gee facing anti-discrimination complaints in Tasmania, and children in Queensland schools who are not permitted to evangelise their school mates.

Last week we prayed for this nation and for our Parliamentarians, and thhis week we thank You for evidence of progress in holding some form of plebiscite, as they government parties promised. We continue to pray for those who seek to uphold definition of marriage. May Your Godly order for families be maintained and may the spiritual forces of darkness be defeated also.

### Ashburton
We give thanks for Your goodness to us here in Ashburton, and for the faithful preaching of Your Word. May we be ever attentive to the reading and preaching we receive, and may we take it in, and respond in faith to the working of Your Holy Spirit applying it to us daily for our sanctification.

We pray for those among our number in need of Your special care today. We remember Eric Edwards who is now in glory, and pray for Your comfort for his family and friends. We also lift up Jim Gleeson, Diane and Muriel French.

We pray for the work to which You have called us here, and particularly for the Holmesglen outreach, where some blockage has hindered progress. We ask that the blockage be removed so that plans can be put into action for a Christian club on campus and a support ministry to the students. These setbacks can be frustrating Lord, but we ask that we be able to minister Your grace in everything, so that whatever we do may be received well by the Holmesglen administration, in Jesus' Name we pray, AMEN. 

And now I will hand back to Barry as we stand to sing our next hymn.
