Ashburton Missions Giving
================

Ashburton congregational mission support operates on a monthly cycle, so that one missionary, family or mission agency is supported during each month of the year.

The Session selects missionaries/agencies which are 
a) less supported (ie. in greater need) or
b) directly working to distribute the Word (eg. Bible League, Bible Society, Wycliffe/SIL) or
c) linked to the PCV (eg. PresAid working with CCAP), so that we have confidence in the distribution of the funds raised.

Additional giving via other appeals occurs at other times (eg. Good Friday for PCV Chaplaincy work, Tear Fund for Christmas Day).

Operation Christmas Child (shoeboxes appeal) is handled differently. Items are collected for many months with (usually) one theme per month, and then in one month the actual packing of shoeboxes and collection of funds for shipping occurs.  

Mission focus is usually included within the order of service on the second Sunday of the month where the Missions Co-Ordinator will speak about the selected missionaries/agency work.

Mission support monies are recorded separately from the regular collection for the work of the congregation. To assist the managers in correctly accounting for missions giving, please use the special envelopes with bright green labels printed "Missions." 

The preprinted offering envelopes should only be used for open plate regular giving.

All envelopes are collected at the same time as part of our worship in substance and our work for the Kingdom.
