(## Prayers for our World and the Church )Tj

(### 25th October 2020 )Tj
T*
T*
(__Psalms 68:35__ _You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!_)Tj
T*
T*
(### Thanks to God)Tj
T*
(God Almighty, You are indeed awesome and great. Your created everything we see and even the heavens that we can't see. All  was glorious in the beginning. More than the God of one nation or people, Your are Lord of All and even under the effects of the curse caused by Adam's sin, we can still see much of Your glory. )Tj
T*
T*
(Despite the evidence of our eyes, we confess that this world has rejected You, and lives against the good order You established for mankind.)Tj
T*
T*
(We confess the sin of pride which keeps us from turning back to You. Thank You that You rescued us from the depths of our sin by sending Jesus to take our place. We thank You that it is all of Your glorious grace, that while we were still dead in sin and lost in our rebellion against You, You delivered us by raising Jesus from the dead. By the same power which created the world, You transferred us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Your Son.)Tj
T*
T*
(By Your Holy Spirit we have received the righteous life of Jesus, so we can exert His power and strength to resist temptation and be free of sin. We are no longer rebels but we praise You as receivers of the same inheritance that He has.)Tj
T*
T*
(We thank You that we can still worship with the help of technology and that we are still able to sing Your praises in our separated places. Being apart does not prevent us from being a united body of believers, ready to hear Your Word read and preached. )Tj
T*
T*
(### The Wider World ### )Tj
T*
(We thank You that conditions in Victoria are improving as the number of reported Covid cases falls steadily each day. We continue to pray for our leaders and their medical advisers as they plan the scaling back of restrictions. We are encouraged by the news we hear, but there are still restrictions on travel and life is a strain for many. We pray that each outbreak that occurs may be contained quickly and effectively, and that our medicos and hospitals are able to use the best available treatments for their patients.)Tj

T*
(### and the wider Church ###)Tj
T*
(In the wider church, we pray for many missionaries and their families and friends. In so many situations, travel plans have been put on hold, reunions have been deferred and work routines disrupted by coronavirus restrictions. May they know Your grace in increasing measure as they serve patiently, whilst awaiting release from the restrictions. )Tj
T*
T*
( Apart from the coronavirus situation, we remember that Your church still suffers persecution in so many places. Many parts of Africas, Aisa and the Middle East, South America and even parts of Europe there are those who want to see the Church of God destroyed. We pray for those suffering at this time, knowing that they receive no publicity, no sympathy and tehre is no outcry about the injustices they suffer. But we bring their plight before You because we know that You are their God Who cares.  )Tj
T*
T*
(### Ashburton)Tj
T*
(Here in Ashburton, we give thanks that we remain generally healthy but remember that there are other matters of health and well-being to pray for.)Tj
T*
T*
(We give thanks for Alan's recovery after his fall, and for his optimistic cheerfulness through it all. We continue to give thanks for Russell's successful eye surgery and pray for his comfort after the removal of his stitches. We also pray for Jocelyn's continued recovery. Strengthen her daily Lord, so she can work with confidence without becoming overtired.)Tj
T*
T*
(We also uphold Barry, Mook, the musicians and the team preparing our video services. We also pray for the Elders and the Board as they plan for restoration of services in person, and the conditions to be met for us to be able to that. )Tj
T*
T*
(We thank You for the activities of our congregation which can operate: the Sunday School lessons, online prayer time, and fellowship after the video service. We pray that the videos might reach out beyond our own numbers and bless those outside the church too.)Tj
T*
T*
(In everything we do, may we strive to make known that we have a sure hope in Our Lord, Jesus Christ, so that those who see us may learn of Him and come to know Him as we do. )Tj
T*
T*
(All these things we pray for the sake of the Kingdom and for the glory of the King of Kings, Amen.)Tj
