## 28 May 2017


On behalf of the Session, Welcome to this service of worship, and special welcome to visitors. We invite you to stay after the service and join us for a cuppa in the hall.
### This week 
1. Easy English Bible Study on Wednesday
1. Thursday - ESL

### Special Events
1. We are invited to attend the first (and hopefully annual) HCCC Chaplains Service to be held on Sunday afternoon 25th June at Scots Church, Melbourne from 2.30pm. This is a special opportunity to give thanks to God for the work of all our staff and associated Chaplains and to acknowledge various movements and upcoming changes for our workers at this time.
1. You may recall that some months ago we hosted missionaries Calvin & Ruth Mathys and their children. Calvin is an aircraft maintenance mechanic and Ruth trains Bible translators. We have been advised by APWM that they have been called back to PNG because of urgent needs there BUT they can't go because their support level is not yet enough to sustain them in the field.
Our support for them has been sent as a lump sum but they are in need of regular monthly support. So if you believe God is prompting you to support them in prayer and financially month by month (which is different to how our missions support works) then please see me afterwards for more details.

1. Board of Management nominations: over the last two weeks we have sought nominations for up to five positions on the Board. The nominations we have received have been three - those people retiring by rotation have all been nominated to continue. Therefore it will not be necessary to conduct an election.
