On behalf of the Session, Welcome to this service of worship, and special welcome to visitors. We invite you to stay after the service and join us for a cuppa in the hall.

You will have received a pew sheet as you came in today, with information about events coming up soon.
Please let us know afterwards of any suggestions you may have.

In addition to the items listed, I can tell you about
### This week

1. Thursday - ESL classses: the new term has begun, already we have welcomed one new student, and we are expecting more for this week.



### Special Events
1. PWMU THANKSGIVING RALLY
Thursday 17th August 10.30 am - 2.30 pm
Robert White Hall, 156 Collins St Melbourne
Morning tea available from 10.00 am
1. Church AGM 20th August after the worship service (Second notice)
1.  Canberra Declaration 7th Anniversary. Godly people put together a declaration of three sets of basic Biblical values which form the foundation of the democratic traditions and lifestyle we enjoy in Australia. There are similar Declarations in the USA and the UK, making it clear that God's order as declared in His Word is part of His common grace and blessing for all people. It provides the freedom which the Church needs to then declare His special grace of salvation to all whom He calls.
1. Those fundamental values - religious freedom, marriage and family, and the sanctity of human life are constantly under threat, and today in the hall you will find a petition against Euthanasia.
As a denomination we are pro-life, trusting God in all  things, ("The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away"), so if you are opposed to the State government plans for euthanasia we invite you to sign the petition.
