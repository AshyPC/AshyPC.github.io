## 27 May 2018

On behalf of the Session, Welcome to this service of worship, and special welcome to visitors. We invite you to stay after the service and join us for a cuppa in the hall.

You will have received a pew sheet as you came in today, with information about events coming up soon.

### In addition to the items listed, I can tell you about

### This week  

1. Congregational Meeting to follow the service and morning tea.
1. We concluded the nominations for the Board of Management last Sunday and find it unnecessary to hold an election, as the nominations were just enough to fill the five vacancies. 
1. Sunday 2nd June will be a Communion service, followed by a church lunch.


### Mission & Other Newsletters  



And now I will hand over to Peng for today's reading from Romans.
