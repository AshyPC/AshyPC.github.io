On behalf of the Session, Welcome to this service of worship, and special welcome to visitors. We invite you to stay after the service and join us for a cuppa in the hall.


### This week 
1. Easy English Bible Study on Wednesday
1. Thursday - ESL classses: the last for this term (2 week break, resuming 20th July)



### Special Events
1. As we previously announced, we are invited to attend the first (and hopefully annual) HCCC Chaplains Service this afternoon at Scots Church, Melbourne from 2.30pm. This is a special opportunity to give thanks to God for the work of all our staff and associated Chaplains and to acknowledge various movements and upcoming changes for our workers at this time.
