## Prayers for our World and the Church with Confession

## 20th June 2021 (Revitalization Weekend)

__Ps 67:1-2__ _	God be gracious to us and bless us, And cause His face to shine upon us—
		That Your way may be known on the earth, Your salvation among all nations._

### Thanks to God
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are gracious to us and You do not abandon Your people, despite our many failings. We thank You for the blessings of common grace which You pour out on all people. And we thank You that You cause Your face to shine upon us.

We thank You for the ordinary things of life: for a relatively free country, for abundance of provision, for home and family. We thank You that You bless us with mostly good health, ready access to medical care, work as well as rest. And we thank You for Your special blessing of salvation.

### Confession of our sin
We confess that we are weak, prone to sin and that we had turned our back on You. We were dead in sin while we thought we were alive. We thank You that You sent Jesus on a rescue mission – to save us out of our distress. He came to take our place and suffer the penalty which we deserved, dying in our stead so we could go free. We thank You for those who spread this Good News to every land, so that there was someone to tell us of Your great love.

Yet Lord, we recognise that until Jesus returns we will be less than perfect. We will fall for temptation, be misled by that liar the devil who, though defeated at the Cross, remains Your enemy. He still seeks to steal our peace, kill the life we have received, and destroy the evidence of the Holy Spirit’s daily sanctification.

However, we thank You that he is defeated, and that You lead and guide us. Help us to attune our ears to the gentle voice of the Holy Spirit, so that we respond more to Him and less to the temptations of the world.

### The Wide World 
We continue to pray for the defeat of the Covid19 virus both here in Victoria and interstate, and thank You that there are still no fatalities from the latest wave of infections. We pray that all patients may recover fully.

We also continue to pray for other nations and especially the people of India, where the virus has taken such a toll. We pray for the national and State governments as they seek to keep their health systems functioning. We pray for those affected, and the families of those who have died. We uphold Aash whose cousin has lost her husband and their family is now without their father. Lord, Your Word often speaks to us of Your care for widows and orphans. Be their strength and comfort at this time, we ask.

### ... and in the wider Church
We bring before You the work of Your church, particularly the Presbyterian Church in Queensland. We pray that You would grant grace, sustain the work of ministry and work all things to achieve Your purposes.

We thank You for the work of Chris Siriweera and the Ministry Development Committee which works to serve our churches so that they may see more souls won for the Kingdom.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You for the wisdom and insights Chris brought yesterday as we studied the task of Revitalization. May we, as Your people in this congregation, remain ever-alive and ready as instruments in Your gracious hand to extend the Kingdom by our work within this community. Holy Spirit, enable us to put what we have learned into action, to be “on the Lord’s side” as the hymn says, and to do the right things in the right way, so that we honour the Name of Jesus always.

We pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We pray that our fellowship continues to grow stronger as we meet each week, both in Sunday worship and in our community groups. We pray also that we may see what You see of the many in our community who need to know the peace of forgiven sin, the assurance of salvation and freedom from the fear of a hopeless end. May we be bringers of this Good News to those whom you draw to yourself.

Whilst we give thanks for our health, for You are the God Who is our health, we remember those who are ailing in various ways. We uphold Barbara, James, Shiun, and Margaret. We give thanks that Diane is home but being monitored for heart issues. May she know the peace that passes understanding as she rests in You.

And now we pray for Chris as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. May we be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that Your living Word goes deep into our hearts. Holy Spirit, we pray that You would change us so that we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word. May we grow in grace daily, so that we glorify the Name of our Risen Lord everywhere we go. 

In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.
