## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 3rd April 2022

__Psalm 92:1-2__ 
_It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we give You thanks today, and praise Your Name because You are God Most High. We thank You for Your faithfulness morning and night. We falter, we stumble, we turn aside from Your ways but You remain faithful to Your promises and to Your Church. 

As we approach the Easter season we remember that Jesus came to redeem a people for Himself, to build a Chuch that would withstand the worst that an enemy could do. We thank You that Jesus voluntarily gave up His heavenly position to limit Himself to our earthly life. But He never took His eye off the eternal prize, the reason for which He came - complete victory over sin.

Today and every day we honour Him as Lord, as the King of Kings. We remember His victory by celebrating the Lord’s Supper, and we give You thanks for the great exchange: He took what was rightly ours – the guilt, the penalty, the shame of the Cross – and instead gave us His perfect righteousness. By Your adoption we can be free from the power of sin. We thank You that He is the Source of Life to us, and our Great High Priest Who intercedes for us before Your Throne of Grace.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we still see much strife, war and its terrible consequences. We continue to pray for the refugee situation in the Ukraine, especially for the aid workers being mobilised to help, and for the people displaced from the war zone. May they quickly find a safe haven away from the fighting.

We continue to pray for the receding flood situation in Queensland and NSW. We pray for those working in the aftermath, when it is no longer “news” to clean up, to restore and rebuild roads, towns and homes.

We thank You again for Your mercy as we see the decline in Covid cases around the nation. We give thanks for the easing of  restrictions, and we pray for our chaplaincy ministries as people turn to You for comfort and guidance. As our communities emerge from under the cloud of Covid, we pray for the restoraion of what we used to call normal life, the rebuilding of relationships and the resumption of our many and varied activities be they recreational, study, work or voluntary interests.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we continue to pray for the growth of fellowship within our community groups. Enable us all to grow in grace, caring for one another, praying and encouraging one another as we learn more from Your Word and then put it into practice daily. We pray for the elders and the Board as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community know the love of God, His gracious forgiveness and the joy of serving Him in restored wholeness.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Shiun, and for Diane dealing with a variety of medical concerns. We thank You for successsful operations for John McKenzie and myself and pray for continuing recovery and rehabilitation back to full health. We also remember Shon’s protective visa application and continue to seek the immigration minister’s favour in granting Shon full permission to stay in Australia.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. As we listen we pray for wisdom, discernment and fresh insight, knowing that we live always in the shadow of the Cross, guided by the light of the Resurrection, so that whatever we do will honour Jesus, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
