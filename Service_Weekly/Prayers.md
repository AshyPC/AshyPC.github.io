## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 2nd July 2023

__Psalm 92:1‭-‬2__ 
_It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night_

### Thanks to God
Father God, we give You thanks today for Your steadfast love for us. Today we celebrate the Lord’s Supper, which helps us to remember that Jesus came to redeem us, to seek and save the lost, as an expression of Your love towards us, and Your faithfulness in keeping Your covenant promises.

We recognise that we are powerless to save ourselves, and are in desperate need of Your great mercy, and then we thank You that we can sing Your praises. You are the great God Who made all things, and yet You know us each by name, better than we know ourselves.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where most have turned their back on You. We see so much persecution in other places, and thank You for sparing us. But we continue to pray for fellow believers in other places where it is death to own the Name of Jesus, and today we pray especially for Your people in Africa. We see so many nations listed by Barnabas Aid where opponents of the Gospel attack and kill Your people. We focus on the terrorist attack on the school in Uganda, and pray for families grieving the loss of their children, and for the safety of those who have fled from the area.

Meanwhile we give thanks that the Gospel is unstoppable, even in the face of such dangers.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the work of grace here, seeing the gospel take root as people come to faith, one by one. We continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program, and we pray for the church camp, as another means of growing in Godliness towards spiritual maturity. We continue to recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We therefore seek to do as He did when on this earth, and be guided by the Holy Spirit in everything we do.

We give thanks for Your Word, the sword of the Spirit. As Barry comes to preach that Word to us today, we thank You for his preparation, and pray that we will become more diligent doers, and not hearers only. We want to grow in discernment, and become more diligent servants as we obey our Servant King, Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
