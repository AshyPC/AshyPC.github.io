## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 17th December 2023

__Psalm 130:7__ 
_But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation;_
_O Israel, hope in the Lord!_
_For with the Lord there is steadfast love,_
_and with Him is plentiful redemption._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You for Your steadfast love, Your full redemption, originally promised to Your people Israel, but extended to us who are not Your chosen nation. We acknowledge that we need redemption because we are sinners who cannot save ourselves.

We thank You for Your promise to Adam and Eve that One would come to crush the head of the serpent who tempted them to sin. We thank You for Your promise to Abraham that he would be a blessing to every nation on earth, every person whose faith was like his. We thank You that Jesus is the fulfillment of that promise, and the focus of our hope in Your perfect salvation.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
In this world at this time, we see the sinfulness of mankind, the result of the Fall, showing how great is the need for Jesus, the Saviour of the world. So many are perplexed by events they canâ€™t understand or change, so that they have given up any hope for a bright future.

We thank You that we take time to remember His first coming, as a babe, and that there are still many who recall Christmas without so much commerciaism, who long in their hearts for the Hope of Israel to be their hope, too.

We pray for Your Church, the Body of Christ, to continue to proclaim the Truth that Jesus is the Reason for the Season. That may be a catchy phrase, yet we pray that people will recognise the truth of what is preached, and respond in faith.

### Ashburton
We pray for our local community to respond to the Carols flyers and join us this evening to hear that God has provided a sure Hope, full redemption because of His steadfast love. We pray that we would welcome those who come, build relationships with them and they might know the love of God as we reach out to bless them.

We recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We pray for us to grow towards spiritual maturity, using the means of discipleship, prayer and fellowship.

We pray also that You would restore those among us who are unwell or struggling in their circumstances, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, the God of our salvation,  Amen.
