## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 86:11__ _Teach me Your way, Lord , that I may rely on Your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your Name._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are forever faithful and we can rely on Your faithfulness, as does the Psalmist. 

We thank You for Jesus Who was completely faithful and fully obedient to Your purposes, so that we could be rescued from the clutches of the enemy.

We thank You for Your written Word, preserved through the ages, the record of Your dealings with wayward and rebellious mankind.

We thank You that You have sent the Holy Spirit to be our teacher and guide, so that we may clearly understand Your ways.

### The World & The Church
Lord, we know our weaknesses and we than You for Your Church as a means of grace, and for our fellow believers who encourage, admonish and support us in our walk of faith, whom we can pray for and encourage also. 

We pray that with their help we may learn Your ways so that we may be undivided in our loyalty to our Risen King, and obedient to His call to make disciples. Help us to seize every opportunity to share the Good News of the Kingdom - reconciliation and peace with God.

### Ashburton
Lord, we thank You for answered prayer for Suzanne, who has new work, and we pray that it will be enough to fulfill her visa requirements.

We also pray for those amongst us in need of Your healing hand. We especially pray for Jim Gleeson and Muriel French now enjoying some respite care. May it be also a time of rest for her family who care for her most closely. We also want to liftr up to You Eric, Ruth, Michael, Bruce, Ken, Nola and Manfred. Even though they can't always be with us, we recognise them as members of the Body of Christ here.

And we again pray safe travel for John & Gaye as they commence their trip today.

We pray all these things Lord, knowing that You lead us in our praying so that Your purposes will be fulfilled, for You are the One Who answers, and You are the One to Whom all praise belongs. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles and follow today's second reading from the end of Matthew's Gospel on page 706.
