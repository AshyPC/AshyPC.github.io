## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 112:4__ _Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord God, we have come today by appointment to bring You praise and worship. We thank You that You are the God Who said "let there be light" and created the heavens and the earth out of nothing. We acknowledge Your Almighty power displayed in the Creation. You made man to be the pinnacle of that Creation, to rule under Your authority and to work within it to show Your glory.

But Adam and Eve rebelled and fell, so that there was darkness, sin and death which spoiled Your good Creation. Nevertheless You provided the way of salvation and we thank You for Jesus Who came to redeem all that was lost in the Garden, and to bring about a New Creation with a body of people filling the City of God, the New Jerusalem, with glory, honour and praise for the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

### The World & The Church
We thank You for bringing us out of the kingdom of darkness and into the marvellous light of the Kingdom of Your Son. By ourselves, we cannot be upright or gracious, but You have removed our rebellion and given us a righteousness not our own, so that we may now be compassionate and gracious to others, showing them the same grace and forgiveness that we have received from You through the Cross. 

We thank You for the Body of Christ which is the army of the heavenly kingdom, regaining territory in this world. We thank You for spiritual weapons of prayer and Your Word, by which we can do our part in releasing captives from a defeated enemy. 

We pray that Your church would use those weapons graciously and compassionately as we seek out those Whom You have marked for salvation. We ask again that You would grant us a greater fervour to find them so that they can be part of the great multitude John saw in the Revelation, that there will be praise for the Lamb of God from every tribe and nation. 

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, Lord, we thank You that You have shone Your light upon us and drawn us into Your kingdom. We pray that we likewise can bring compassion and grace into everything we do, individually and as a church.

We thank You for watching over our travellers. Thank You for the safe return of the McKenzies, and we pray again for Tat and Julie in London. We also continue to uphold those in need of Your healing hand: Jim Gleeson, Muriel French and Sue Barber in particular. Thank You for restoring MarJo, and for those who filled the gap by taking the ESL classes.



Finally, Lord, we thank You for the leading of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives. We pray that as we read Your Word, as we speak to others, as we serve in practical ways, we would be doing all these things as unto the Lord, to further the Kingdom and for Your glory alone. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Gaye to bring us today's second reading from second Samuel.
