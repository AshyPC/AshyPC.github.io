## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 13th October 2024

__Psalm 31:24__ 
    _Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the Lord!_

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today, giving thanks that our salvation is not something we ourselves have achieved, for we are weak, changeable and lost in a world which does not want to know You. However, You are the LORD Almighty, strong to save, faithful in love, yet righteous in judgement. Because Jesus Christ the Righteous One has taken the penalty which was rightly ours, and dealt with the guilt we know within, we can be free.


__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
Lord, You have called us to persist in prayer, whether we are many or few, because You are the Only God, the One Who answers prayer. 

We continue to pray that the Prince of Peace would bring the peace we long for. And in the meantime, we pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the nation of Israel, as it fights to preserve its own freedom and oppose tyranny and terrorism. We pray against the expressions of anti-Semitism we have seen displayed at demonstrations and rallies around the world, and we are distressed at Australiaâ€™s weakness in international forums.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We give thanks for the many thousands who joined the March for the Babies in the city yesterday, quietly and respectfully protesting at the ongoing slaughter of so many innocent lives. We pray that Your church would declare with one voice that You are the God of life, Who has overcome death.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace in our lives through the daily routines, the ups and the downs of our lives. We thank You for Your Word which calls us to take courage, and to know that Your face shines upon us even when our human weaknesses try to bring us down to despair. Help us we pray to look up to You and remember the great salvation You have provided in Jesus.

We pray for our public witness through the Carols service in December. Help us to plan activities to demonstrate Your love working through us towards the visitors who come.

We thank You Lord for Josh Lyddy and his family with us today. Grant him a clear mind and strong voice to deliver what You have given him for our edification today.

And we pray for our diligent attention to Your Word, so that the world may know that only Jesus saves!

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
