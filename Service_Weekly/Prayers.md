## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 23rd Jun 2019
__Prov 30:4__ _Who has ascended into heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in His hands? Who has wrapped the waters in His garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name or His son's name?_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, You granted Solomon wisdom far above any other man on this earth and even he was awed at Your might. Later You sent the One Who is greater than Solomon, the Only-begotten Son, Who walked this earth as one of us. He remained sinless, and yet sinful men crucified Him, because of sin, our sin.

We thank You that this was no accident of history but part of the plan prepared within the counsels of the Trinity to redeem lost and sinful men and women, including us. We thank You that Jesus came to stand in our place and pay the penalty, to free us from the guilt of our offence before You, to release us from the power of that sin which yet so easily entangles us, to make us acceptable in Your sight.We thank You that now He calls us brethren and we stand by Your grace as adopted  members of the royal family of heaven.

### The World and the Church
We pray for this world where so many do not know who Solomon is, nor of Whom he speaks. There are those who stand in awe of the natural forces over which they have no control, and there are those who believe that mankind is greater than all of nature and can do whatever he chooses. We pray for them to have their eyes opened to truly see and understand Who has established the ends of the earth. 

We pray for the Church to realise that this world holds it in disdain and not with respect and that, as a result, the Name of Jesus is brought low. We pray that we would be enabled by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Truth in word and deed. May we demonstrate in our lives together that the Church pursues holiness and wants to see Jesus high and lifted up, so that He may draw all men to Himself. 

We pray also for the work of those parts of the Church worldwide which minister to the needs of people suffering persecution for their faith. We especially uphold the work of Barnabas Fund and pray for wise stewardship of the funds which we entrust to them via our missions giving.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We thank You for the faithful preaching we receive from Barry and Mook, and pray that You would continue to protect them and their families from the wiles of the enemy as they serve You and us in the preaching and teaching ministry to which You have called them.

We pray for the elders, the Board of Management, Sunday School leaders and teachers, the ESL team and the leaders and workers in the Seniors ministry. As they minister in Your name and the name of the church may they also be protected by Your Holy Spirit. 

We pray for our fellowship here and thank You for the mutual encouragement of our fellow believers. We pray for those travelling, remembering John & Gaye McKenzie and Sandra and Newton Mattison. We particularly pray for Sandra's brother James with inoperable cancer and we pray for the whole family as they face the difficulty of his condition.

We pray also for others who can't be with us and remember Muriel French in care and Bruce Massie in Epworth Hospital. Be with them we pray so that they may know Your comfort and the strength of our bonds of fellowship one with another.

As we work together, we pray for continued blessing on the preparatory work of the building project, so that all we do with what You give us is dedicated to the purposes of winning people into the Kingdom of the One and Only Saviour, our Redeemer, In Whose Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now Seng will bring our second reading for today.
