## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 9th January 2022

__2 Timothy 1:7__ 
_God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come into Your Presence today, acknowledging that You remain ever-sovereign over our circumstances. We may waver but You never change, You remain faithful, purposeful and gracious towards us.

We honour the Lord Jesus as the King of Kings, Whom You have installed on the throne to reign over us. We thank You that He holds the keys of death and Hades, He is alive for evermore, and You have granted us His life and righteousness in place of our sin, rebellion and self-centredness.

Therefore as we remember His victory on the Cross and in the Resurrection, we can lay aside any fears of what man may do to us. Grant us courage as we take up the power of the Holy Spirit planted within, to humbly serve others, to live lives which honour Him and to glorify Your Name on this Earth.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We look about this world where leaders are perplexed at current events, who need to bow to Your Supreme Authority, and we continue to pray for Your grace and mercy. May Your Church be seen as the bulwark of the Truth, not in an arrogant way but in loving concern for those who do not acknowledge the King. Help us to bring the Good News that this King is no earthly tyrant but One Who knows us from within, Who therefore understands our every weakness, and Who rules in Perfect love.

We thank You again for Your mercy as we see more evidence for the milder effects of the Covid omicron variant. As this latest variant spreads so rapidly around the world, we pray for true wisdom for authorities and understanding of what is required. We pray for wider availability of testing kits and for care with their use. May we be self-controlled and responsible in seeking our own protection, as well as in considering the needs of others around us, even as some restrictions have been re-introduced.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for all who are able to take a break. We pray Your protection and for their safety in travel, and that wherever they go they may be a blessing, even as they rest and refresh themselves.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. As we listen we pray for wisdom and discernment, that we may live according to Your Word, grow stronger in our faith and bring honour to the Name of Jesus, the King of Kings, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
