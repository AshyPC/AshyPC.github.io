## Prayers for our World and the Church with Confession

## 4th July 2021 (US Independence Day)

__1 Tim 2:1-2__ _First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are not only the God of the Church or of Your redeemed people alone. As we have sung, You are the King of Creation, sovereign over the entire earth, Sustainer of all life. In You we live and move and have our being. We thank You for the blessings of common grace which You pour out on all people. And we thank You that You cause Your face to shine upon us, and for Your special blessing of salvation.

We admit that we are weak, prone to sin and that we had turned our back on You. We thank You that You sent Jesus to save us out of our distress. He came to take our place and suffer the penalty which we deserved, to give up His life to defeat the power of sin, and to forgive us so that we should no longer be bowed down by the guilt of our offences before You.

We thank You that You lead and guide us by Your Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Trinity. Help us to attune our ears to His gentle voice, so that we grow in grace and Christ-likeness day by day.

### The Wide World 
We continue to pray against the Covid19 virus both here in Victoria and interstate, and thank You that there are still no fatalities. We pray for other States to be able to control the outbreaks and for travel restrictions to ease soon.

We also continue to pray for other nations. We give thanks for improvements in the situation in India, but pray for Indonesia and nations in South America, where the virus continues to spread. We pray for the various governments as they seek to keep their health systems functioning. We pray for those affected, and the families of those who have died.

### ... and in the wider Church
We bring before You the work of Your church, particularly the persecuted church in various places where terrorists take advantage of the news coverage of Covid19 to attack Your people. We pray that You would grant grace, sustain the work of ministry even when pastors and leaders are taken away, and work all things to achieve Your purposes. May Your people be strong and courageous, like Joshua and the nation of Israel entering the promised land.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You that the work of Revitalization has begun, and for the decision of the congregational meeting last week. We ask You to guide the Board in selecting a selling agent and pray for continued wisdom as we proceed through the steps necessary to conclude the sale of the manse, including presenting our case to the Presbytery and the Assembly for their approval.

We pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We pray that our fellowship continues to grow stronger each week, and that we increase in our care and prayer for each other. As we do so, we want to uphold Barbara, Diane and Shiun as they continue to recover.

And now we pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. May we be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that Your living Word goes deep into our hearts. Help us to see in Your Word that You are the God of real people who lived in a particular place and time. May we see the God of Heaven Who is near and Who cares for His people, so that we glorify the Name of our Risen Lord everywhere we go. In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now we come to the reading of the Scriptures in two parts by Sandra and Tim.
