## Prayers for our World and the Church with Confession

## 22nd August 2021 (Still locked down and curfewed)

__Psalms 70:4__ _May all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You!
May those who love Your salvation say evermore, “God is great!”_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are the God of All Creation, the Only God Who is indeed great. We acknowledge that because of Adam’s fall, we have been prone to sin and had turned our back on You. Yet now we thank You that You have changed us so that  we seek You, we rejoice in You and we are glad that our lives have been turned around because You sent Jesus to save us.

We thank You for Jesus’ promise to never leave us nor forsake us and that You sent the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us, so that we will grow in grace and Christ-likeness day by day.

### The Wide World 
The Covid19 virus remains the most prominent news item of our time, and we continue to pray for its containment both here in Victoria and interstate. We thank You that there are still so few fatalities, especially compared to last year, and that the total number of cases seems to be on the decline. We pray for all States to be able to control their outbreaks and for our leaders to apply Godly wisdom in all their deliberations. We pray that the full range of medical treatments would be applied to provide for maximum relief, and pray for all the research efforts to bear fruit soon.

We also continue to pray for other nations. We give thanks for improvements in Indonesia and nations in South America. We pray for the various governments as they seek to keep their health systems functioning. We pray for those affected, and the families of those who have died.

In other tragic news we have seen the swift and dramatic overthrow of the government in Afghanistan, and the resurgence of terrorism there. We pray for the people, especially those believers who are suffering persecution at the hands of terrorists.

We also pray for the people of Haiti where two natural disasters have occurred. Many thousands are homeless as the result of a severe earthquake which was followed by a heavy tropical storm. We pray for rescue efforts and quick provision of shelter during the rest of the hurricane season.

### ... and in the wider Church
We bring before You the work of Your church, and pray that Your people everywhere may be ready to give a gracious answer to those who ask about the hope we have in You. We pray, as we confront the isolation due to lockdowns, that You would enable us to strengthen our bonds of fellowship and overcome the separations imposed by government measures so that Your people may shine the light of the Gospel in what appears to be a dark time.

### Ashburton

Here in Ashburton we thank You that You have sustained us with so little impact from the virus. We thank You for the excellent medical facilities available around us here. We pray for the work of Revitalization. We pray also for the rebuilding of our bonds of fellowship one with another. Help us all to find ways to support each other in our separated homes. As we do so, we thank You for the progress made by Margaret, Barbara, Diane and Shiun as they continue to recover.

We pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen.  Help us to see in Your Word that You are the God of real people who lived in a particular place and time, and You called them to live in full obedience to Your ways. May we also see what we need to do to bring our lives into fully conformity with Your law and Your ways.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.
