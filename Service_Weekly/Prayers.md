## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 27th August 2023

__Psalm 55:22__ 
_Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you;_
_he will never let the righteous be shaken._
(From a Psalm of David expressing his distress but still trusting God)

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You today, for You care for Your Creation, and sustain it, not only keeping the stars in their place and the planets orbiting the Sun, but You care for us as individuals, we who need your grace daily.

We thank You that You sent Jesus to redeem us, so that we could exchange our unrighteousness for His Perfect Righteousness. We are now without shame or fear, because You have forgiven our guilt, paid the penalty and cancelled the power of our sin.

We thank You that we can return to Your holy Presence, bringing our praise and our petitions to Your Throne of Grace, to receive mercy and help in our time of need.


### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where most deny the Truth and try to ignore You. We thank You for the work of MAF and the Mathys family, bringing the gospel to people in need. We thank You for Calvin’s skills in keeping their aircraft flying safely to serve the people of PNG. We ask You to uphold Ruth in her teaching role so that translators may faithfully render Your Word into local languages.

We thank You that the gospel is Your powerful means of turning people from enemies into adopted members of Your family of the redeemed.

We thank You also that Your Word is preached in so many places around the world, so that the Kingdom advances daily as more and more are added to our number.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the work of grace here, seeing the gospel take root as people come to faith. We thank You for the New Life Korean congregation sharing these premises, and pray for continued growth in our relationship. May we work more closely together for the sake of the Kingdom as we seek to serve this community.

We continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program, “Thy Kingdom come” here as You raise up workers with the giftings necessary to fulfill Your purposes. We pray for us to grow towards spiritual maturity, using the means of discipleship and community groups. We thank You for those unbelievers who have attended Introducing God and Hope Explored. We ask that You continue to lead them to faith in Jesus.

We recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We seek to bless this community in service by finding how we can make a difference in Jesus Name.

We pray also that You would sustain and restore those among us who are unwell or struggling in their circumstances, so that we may not be shaken as we trust in Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
