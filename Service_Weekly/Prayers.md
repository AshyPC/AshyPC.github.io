## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 19th May 2024

__Psalm 32:11__ 
    _Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous ones; And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we give You thanks today, taking to heart the words of David. Because You have forgiven our sins and adopted us into Your heavenly family, we are able to rejoice as “righteous ones”. We thank You that You sent Jesus to make us His friends, even though we had turned away from You and become Your enemies. We thank You that He is not ashamed of calling us His brothers and sisters, because He took our unrighteousness upon Himself and gave us, in exchange, His perfect righteousness, His very Life.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for our world because wherever we look there are forces at work creating division instead of working for peace. We thank You for the work of Barnabas Aid and similar agencies seeking to minister to the homeless, the refugees and the oppressed in so many places. We thank You for those places where Jesus is lifted up and people are reconciled one to another, and we long to see more of the same.

We pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the safety of Jewish people everywhere as they face increasing hostility. We pray for believers who face daily persecution in many parts of the world. Strengthen and encourage them as they hold fast to their Lord and Saviour, just as we do.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities to work for unity rather than division, for the good of all rather than for special interests.

We continue to uphold our remote and indigenous communities, and we yearn for true reconciliation through the work of the Gospel, and a move of the Holy Spirit. We are saddened by the loss of trust and harmony within communities, local and remote, and pray that it might be rebuilt as more people place their trust in You, the Great Healer.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to reach our local community here. We pray for opportunities to witness to Your great love, and Your desire that more and more would honour Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. We have plenty of room for new people to come, to learn of the forgiveness of their sins at the Cross, and join us in worship.

Help us to welcome all who come. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued witness to those around us, both as a congregation and one by one where we live, study, and work. In the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
