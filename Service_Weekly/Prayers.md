## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 12th November 2017
__Ezekiel 18:32__ _For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares the Lord. "Therefore, repent and live."_ 


__John 15:13__ _Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends._ 

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today to honour You as the Author and Sustainer of all life. We thank You for Jesus Who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. We thank You that He showed Your love, the greatest love, towards us by laying down His life for every believer, everyone past, present and future who is included in the Body of Christ.

### The World and the Church
From Your Word we understand the terrible truth of Adam's sin, the Fall and the Curse, and we see the result too readily in wars and strife throughout history. We also see that the Way to the Tree of Life was guarded with a flaming sword until Your redemptive purposes were fulfilled.

From that same Word we also learn the Glorious Truth of the Redemption won for us by Jesus in the Cross and the Resurrection and, in the future, the reopening of the Way to the Tree of Life.

We thank You for Your Church which You are building up daily. We thank You for saints of the past, those who preserved and delivered to succeeding generations the Word and the Faith. We marked yesterday as Remembrance Day and we also thank You for those who have defended our nation and our freedom to worship You according to Your Word, without fear of oppression or interference. We pray that we would be equally faithful to deliver the same Faith to the coming generations.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We give thanks for the safe return of John & Gaye, and we pray for safe travel for others about to depart, just as we remember Tat & Julie still travelling in Europe. We also pray for those in our midst who are in need of Your particular love and care. May we be instruments of mercy to our fellow believers.

We pray for Your guidance as we prepare for next week's Ashwood festival. We ask for the words to speak as we meet those in our local community, so that this Word which we hear read and preached weekly, would be for our community too. Again we ask that Your mercy and love would be seen in us as we show the Holy Spirit's work in our lives more and more each day to those whom we meet and work with. In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will ask Peng to come forward and bring our second reading of the Word, from Romans.
