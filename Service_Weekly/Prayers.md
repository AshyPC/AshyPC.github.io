## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 23rd July 2017

__Psalm 17:6-7__ _I have called upon You, for You will answer me, O God; Incline Your ear to me, hear my speech. Wondrously show Your lovingkindness, O Savior of those who take refuge at Your right hand From those who rise up against them._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
Father God, You are Lord over all of Your Creation, Heaven is Your throne and the earth is Your footstool, yet You hear us when we call. When David wrote these words, he protested his innocence, but in other places he knew his guilt. Like him we know that we are sinners who need Your saving grace, and we thank You for Your love and mercy towards us. 

### The World and the Church
We thank You for Your Church, the Body of Christ, the guardian of the truth and where we find both encouragement and admonition. 
 
We pray that You would overturn the work of that defeated enemy who still seeks to destroy life, and we pray against those who rise up to attack the Church and individual believers.

We pray today for the active Church, and for those believers who understand the times, and apply Your Word to present-day situations. Whether they are working directly on the business of the Kingdom or not, in the public eye or only seen by their colleagues, we pray that You would strengthen them in pursuing their calling, so that Your Word is not maligned in this world but may be honoured instead.

We pray courage for those like Nathan who need to confront sin in others - would that we are able to receive them when they come to us. We pray that we would be on guard so that we don't speak out rashly to judge others, but rather that we examine our own conduct and come before You in repentance, as David did. 

### Ashburton
We again rejoice in Your goodness to us here in Ashburton, and we pray for the work that You have set before us. We ask that You build up the Youth Group, the Seniors Centre and the Holmesglen Student Ministry, and we pray for all those who will be engaged in these works. May they serve in all diligence, empowered by Your Holy Spirit and recognising Your leading in everything they do.

We thank You for the ESL ministry and for new students who come each week. We pray for the teachers and helpers who work as a team to enable the students to receive the maximum benefit from the classes.

We pray for our various needs, and remember those who can't be with us each week. We thank You for Eruic's recovery, and we pray also for Ruth, Jim, Diane, Nola and Manfred, Michael. Be with them wherever they are so that they will know Your comforting presence. 

In all these things, Lord, we ask that whatever we do may be unto You, and for the honour and glory of Jesus, in whose Name we pray, AMEN. 

And now we come to our next reading from second Samuel chapter 12.
