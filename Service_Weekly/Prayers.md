## Prayers for our World and the Church with Confession

## 1st August 2021 (Communion)

__Psalms 50:14‭-‬15__ _Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving And pay your vows to the Most High;
Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me.”_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are the God of All Creation. You are the worthy King to Whom we bring our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving today. We thank You that You have built Your church to be Your dwelling place forever. We live and breathe by Your abundant Sustaining Word, and You have clothed Your priests with salvation. We thank You that whatever our circumstances we can express our joyful thanks to You.

We admit that because of Adam’s fall, we are weak, prone to sin and that we had turned our back on You. We thank You that You sent Jesus to save us. You have opened the Way for us to be restored, as we will shortly commemorate in the Lord’s Supper, a foretaste of the great Marraige Feast of the Lamb foretold in the Revelation to John.

We thank You for Jesus’ promise to never leave us nor forsake us and that You sent the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us, so that we will grow in grace and Christ-likeness day by day.

### The Wide World 
As the Covi19 virus remains the most prominent news item of our time, we continue to pray for its containment both here in Victoria and interstate, and thank You that there are still so few fatalities, especially compared to last year. We pray for other States to be able to control their outbreaks and for our leaders to apply Godly wisdom in all their deliberations. We pray that the full range of medical treatments would be available throughout our land to provide for maximum relief.

We also continue to pray for other nations. We give thanks for improvements in the situation in India, but pray for Indonesia and nations in South America, where the virus continues to spread. We pray for the various governments as they seek to keep their health systems functioning. We pray for those affected, and the families of those who have died.

### ... and in the wider Church
We bring before You the work of Your church, and pray that Your people everywhere may be ready to give a gracious answer to those who ask about the hope we have in You. We pray, as we confront this “day of trouble”, that You would grant grace, sustain the work of ministry even if pastors and leaders are taken by the virus, and work all things to achieve Your purposes.

### Ashburton

Here in Ashburton we thank You that You have sustained us with so little impact from the virus. We thank You for the excellent medical facilities available around us here. We pray for the work of Revitalization, and thank You for the Board of Investment and Finance decision to appoint our Board’s recommended selling agent and pray for continued wisdom as we proceed through the steps necessary to conclude the sale of the manse.

We pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. Now that we are able to meet again, we pray that our fellowship would grow stronger each week, and that we increase in our care and prayer for each other. As we do so, we thank You for the progress made byMargaret,  Barbara, Diane and Shiun as they continue to recover.


We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. We know that we do not live by bread alone but by every Word that comes from You. Guide Barry by Your Holy Spirit to ensure that He brings us Your living Word.

Help us to see in Your Word that You are the God of real people who lived in a particular place and time. May we see the God of Heaven Who is near and Who rescues His people, so that we may bring You honour both here and in this community - everywhere we go. 

In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

### Offering Hymn

We come now to sing a further prayer to “Revive Your Church, O Lord” and as we sing the managers will take up the offering. For those participating online, there are links available via our website for direct bank transfers.


### Prayer for the Offering
Let us pray.

O Lord, we thank You that as we receive so abundantly, beyond what we could ask or imagine, we could never out-give You. But we bring joyfully out of all that You have blessed us with these our offerings for the work of Your Kingdom. Grant wisdom to those administering these funds and diligence in applying them to their designated purposes.

In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

Callum will now bring us the second reading from Nehemiah.
