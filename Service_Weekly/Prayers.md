## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 24th July 2022

__Psalm 122:1,6__ 
_I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord!
”Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! May they be secure who love you!_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, there is no better place to be than in the House of the Lord. Whether it is this building where we gather to worship You, or this body of Christ to which we belong, we give thanks for the security of Your love for us, which is infinitely stronger than our love for You.

We thank You that we are members of the Body of Christ only because of the forgiveness of our sin, made possible when the Lord Jesus Christ gave Himself for us. As the hymn declares “He emptied Himself of all but love/and bled for Adam’s helpless race.”

We thank You for the peace we enjoy in this nation, on this continent. We thank You for the blessings of the rule of law, and peaceful elections, even when we see that the laws of our land are vastly inferior to Your Perfect Law and Your Perfect Justice.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we pray for the peace of Jerusalem, surrounded as it is by many hostile forces, and we give thanks for those in the region who work for peace day by day. 

We pray for the restoration of order and good government in Sri Lanka where Barnabus Fund works to help provide food and basic services to the people. And we cannot forget the war and refugee situation in the Ukraine.

### Ashburton
We pray for the Church Camp coming up in just a few weeks. Guide all those involved in the planning and organisation. And we give thanks for the camp operators and staff who will be working whilst we are there. May it be a time of rich blessing as we learn more from Your Word and draw closer together. We pray for Peter Sorenson as he prepares to lead the teaching program.

We again pray for the elders, the Board and the leadership team working on our Revitalization program. We earnestly desire that it be a means of seeing the Kingdom of Heaven expand as more people come to love and serve the Lord in restored wholeness.

We thank You again for the blessings of health care we enjoy in this country, as we continue to pray in particular for Shiun and for Diane as she continues to deal with persistent health problems.

And now we pray for Mook as he preaches today. Help us to take Your Word deep into our hearts. May we learn afresh of Your boundless Mercy, so that we too, may espress that same Mercy towards those whom You lead us to each day. And so we pray in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, for Whose Kingdom we work in the strength You give us, Amen.
