## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 18th February 2018

__Isaiah 52:7__ _How lovely on the mountains Are the feet of him who brings good news, Who announces peace And brings good news of happiness, Who announces salvation, And says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"_

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You have called each one of us into Your Presence here today. We thank You that we have heard the Good News and responded. We have come into Your House to praise and worship You, to hear Your Word read and preached, to lift up the Name of Jesus. We are indeed blessed and happy that salvation has been announced, and our God reigns.

We thank You that Jesus, the Eternal Son, came into our world as one of us to bring that salvation to us, to reconcile us to Yourself. He came as the Good Shepherd to find the lost sheep and to show that You are loving and merciful. 

We thank You, Holy Spirit for coming from heaven to testify to Jesus, and to change us to be like Him. We thank You that You do not leave as as we were (sinners) but are making us into saints, fit to serve one another and work together for the Kingdom. 

### The World & The Church
We again see in this world people who feel hopeless in the face of distressing events, and so we pray for our leaders in and out of Parliaments to provide wise leadership and good government. We pray that the shrill voices of self-interest would be replaced by calm voices in the service of our nation. We especially pray that our freedoms would be protected, and that we may use those freedoms responsibly to continue announcing the Good News, as ambassaddors of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

We pray for Your church to declare Your Truth, to graciously recall people to the Cross, to show compassion for the lost and to shepherd them as Your flock. We thank You for the Safe Church Training day yesterday where we were reminded that church should be the safest place for the hurting and vulnerable in our community. 

### Ashburton
We continue to pray as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us as part of Your great work to win souls. Help us to focus our attention and to work within Your purposes for the Ashburton, Chadstone, Holmesglen and Waverley areas. We pray for the ESL program, the Seniors ministry, as they reach out to people and we pray again that You might open the closed doors at the Holmesglen TAFE, so that we may bring good news to those in need of ministry there.  

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now we will come to the second reading from God's Word today, from 2 Samuel chapter 16.
