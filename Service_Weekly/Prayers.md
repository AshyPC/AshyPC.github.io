## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 12th October 2025

**2 Chronicles 15:7** 
_But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that Your appointed prophet, Azariah, spoke boldly to King Asa of Judah, and we thank You that the King listened and acted faithfully, to turn the nation away from worthless idols, and return to You.

We know that we cannot be perfect as You are Perfect, for we are sinners and in trouble in this world. We thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, to save us.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to be with us daily, to come alongside and enable us to resist temptation, to open our minds to Your Word, and to grant us wisdom as we live in this fallen world. We pray that we can hear the still small voice and apply what we hear to the situations in which we find ourselves – whether to resist a subtle temptation, or to speak an encouraging word.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for this world where so many live blindly, not even knowing who Jesus is, or that You love sinners no matter how bad their sin, when they turn away from the futile ways of the world and live.

We pray for this nation and this State, which appears to be so like Judah and Israel of old, far away from You, with leadrs openly hating the people of God and remaking the truth according to their own selfish desires. We pray for a turnaround, so that Your Word is honoured, and righteousness prevails.

We pray for those close to us, who do not know the Truth. We thank You for the churches where Your Word is faithfully preached and lived, and ask that You would strengthen Your people to stand firm but with grace, against the lies so popular today.

**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we also labour with our various talents and abilities in the work of the Kingdom. We pray that we can be found faithful, and persevere in doing good, even though we may not see the results of our work in this life.

We pray for the Selection Committee which meets today, as they seek Your wisdom, and work to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail and we call a new minister of Your choosing, to bring us Your Word and sacraments. We pray for ourselves to support them in their work, as they serve on our behalf in what could be a lengthy process.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane and others affected by illness or injury. We pray for those absent and travelling, that You would keep them safe, grant them fellowship and that they would return safely.

We thank You for Your Word, and for Mook as he preaches today. We pray that we would be diligent hearers and do-ers of Your Word, making the most of the means of grace.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
