## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 28th November 2021

__Psalm 34:3-5__ 
_Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His Name together!
I sought the Lord, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
Those who look to Him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we have come into Your Presence today to magnify Your Name and exalt You as a united body of Your redeemed people.

We thank You that You are the God Who answers prayer, Who delivers us from all our fears.

We know that in this world we can become surrounded by toubles and fears but that because Jesus won the Victory over sin and death, we need never be ashamed. We thank You that You are above all and rule over all, so that we need not despair.

### The Wide World 
We thank You that Jesus warned that in this world we would have trouble but we count it all joy to face trials so that our faith may be strengthened. We continue to pray for persecuted believers in other places in this world, who face far greater trials than we do here.

This month we have been focusing on the work of Voice of the Martyrs, and give thanks for the faithfulness of believers in Indonesia, who have remained steadfast despite extremists mounting terrorist attacks. We give thanks that the Covid situation there has eased considerably, even while it appears to worsen in Europe as they move into winter. We continue to pray for every effort which is being made to overcome the effects of the pandemic.

### ... and in the wider Church
We pray also for Your Church as lockdown regulations are lifted again here in Victoria. We give thanks that many churches are re-opening or planning to do so very soon.

We pray for the rain and flood situation in NSW and Queensland, and ask Your protection over people in affected areas. We pray for safety for the Emergency Services units which will be out dealing with the damage and rescuing stranded people.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we are thankful that services can resume on site, and that our Carols on the Lawn service can proceed on the 12th. We pray for the preparations to go smoothly and that the result will be a blessing to all who attend. We also look forward to restrictions being lifted completely as vaccination targets are achieved.

We pray for Shiun as he progresses in recovery and for Diane’s health while her treatment continues. We continue to pray for Sueie and her family as they adjust to the passing of her sister-in-law. We ask also that You would sustain her brother at this time. In times of trouble, people may realise their need of Jesus, and we pray that he would come to that point and turn to You.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we face the kind of difficulties which Peter’s readers also faced in their time. As we listen we pray for wisdom and discernment, that we may live according to Your Word, taking heed of Peter’s sober warnings of the troubles we face.

In the Name of Jesus, our Present Help in Times of Trouble, we pray all these things, Amen.
