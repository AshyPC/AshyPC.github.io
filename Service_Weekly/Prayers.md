## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 13th July 2025

__Isaiah 26:4__ 
_[4] Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is an everlasting rock._

### Thanks to God
 O Lord, we come to You today, wanting to trust in You completely, but knowing that we are weak and prone to wander. We come seeking Your salvation, for we know we cannot save ourselves.

We thank You that although we turned our back on You, You still hold out salvation to us, because Jesus fulfilled all righteousness on our behalf. He took the punishment we deserved, paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give us His righteousness. We thank You that You are our everlasting Rock, the One on whom we can rely completely.


### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We pray for this world where so many do not even realise that they are lost unless they turn back to You. So many put their trust in things that won’t last, or in people who let them down. Week by week we see that this world seems to continue downward, but we know that You hold the world in Your hands, and You have a plan and purpose which cannot be defeated.

We pray for the persecuted church, recognising that our difficulties are slight compared to those in Africa, suffering much persecution, destruction and hatred.

We pray for our nation which also attacks Your church and Your people, even though what we see here is so mild compared to other places. We pray against the attacks upon the Jewish community, and we stand against terrorism in all its forms. We pray for a great work of the Holy Spirit to turn around many who have been blinded by the vanities of this world. As we uphold Your Word, we pray that it would again be respected by most people, and we pray for people to see their sin and repent. We pray that You would enable us to be faithful witnesses to Your Word of Truth.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as we seek to grow in Godliness and obedience to Your Word; we pray for our study of the Ripple Effect this coming Saturday. May the teaching we receive enable us to confidently speak of the Lord Jesus in our daily lives, in conversation with others.

We pray for Mook to recover quickly, and we thank You for Douglas bringing Your Word to us today at short notice. We give You thanks for Diane’s successful shoulder replacement operation, and pray that You continue to heal her as she recovers at home.

In Jesus Precious Name we ask all these things, Amen.
