## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 4th June 2023

__Matthew 24:42__ 
_Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we give You thanks today for Your great mercies to us. Today we celebrate the Lordâ€™s Supper as a means of grace, which helps us to remember that Jesus came humbly to this earth over 2000 years ago to redeem us, to seek and save the lost. The Supper also points us to a future time when Jesus will return visibly as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, to take full possession of the prize for His complete victory over sin and death and Satan.

But before that happens, Jesus has warned us to keep watch so that we are not surprised or shocked at the coming Day of the Lord. We acknowledge today that, as descendents of Adam, we are prone to forget, and to assume that all of life will continue unchanged.  We are powerless to save ourselves, and are in desperate need of Your great mercy, the gracious Saviour and His finished work, and the Holy Spirit power to turn away from temptation.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where most seem to have forgotten that there will come a Day of Judgement. So many are not on watch, and we pray for an awakening to eternal things. We pray that we would be on watch constantly, living our lives expecting Jesus to return at any moment. We pray that Your people, gathered as the Church for whom Jesus died and rose again, would also live and work with one eye towards the future return of the Bridegroom.


### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here, acknowledging that the Kingdom of God takes precedence over the works of man. We continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program, and give thanks for the unity of purpose which our Re-Vision workshop brought to light. We pray for the congregational meeting next Saturday, as we present the God-given vision for all to grasp. We continue to recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We therefore seek to do as He did when on this earth, and be guided by the Holy Spirit in everything we do.

We give thanks for Your Word, the sword of the Spirit. As Barry comes to preach that Word to us today, we thank You for his preparation, and pray that we will become more diligent doers, watchful as we obey our Servant King, Jesus, Who is also our Lord and Saviour, Amen.

And now let us conclude this time of prayer using the words Jesus taught His disciples:

Our Father, Who is in heaven,
hallowed be Your name;
Your kingdom come;
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

For Yours is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
