## Prayer of Thanksgiving for Christmas Day

## 21st January 2024

__Psalm 61:1-2__ 
_Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer_
_From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint;_
    _lead me to the rock that is higher than I._

#Thanks to God#
O God, we cry out You, taking the words of David for ourselves to say how heavy are our hearts today. You created a world which was very good but death made a ruin and brought sadness because of loss, instead of joy in Your Presence. 

We thank You for Jesus Who is the Resurrection and the Life. We thank You for His death and resurrection which bought us back from the enemy and provided us with Your perfect salvation. We thank You for the sure hope we have because He has ascended to heaven and is seated at Your right hand, and we have the Holy Spirit with us the Comforter and Guide into all truth.

#The Wide World... and the Wider Church#
Lord, we are at the ends of the earth â€“ almost as far from Jerusalem as possible in both time and place. We thank You for Your Church which has upheld the truth delivered once for all to the saints, and we pray that You would continue to strengthen Your people daily as we witness to the Truth of Jesus, even in these times when the Truth is definitely out of favour in our communities.

Within our own nation we pray again about floods in Queensland and another cyclone approaching the coast. We pray for the preparations being made now to ensure as many as possible are safe. We give thanks for the previous restoration work, and again uphold churches in and around the affected areas. May they be equipped to minister in practical ways once again as the state faces more flooding.

#Ashburton#
We pray for ourselves as we move into the new year so differently compared to just a couple of weeks ago. We pray for the local community to respond to the sure Hope of the gospel throughout this new year.

Even though Barry is no longer with us, we recognise that Jesus is still building His church and has called us to join with Him in this task. We may stumble at this setback but we trust that You will uphold us so that we do not fall completely. We pray that You would restore those among us who are unwell or struggling, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, the God of our salvation, Amen.
