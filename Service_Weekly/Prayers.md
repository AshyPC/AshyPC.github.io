## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 7th March 2021

__Psalm 59:16__ _But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress._

While David was beset by enemies seeking his life, he was still able to sing of God’s protection. Let us likewise come to our loving God Who guards His people.

### Thanks to God
O Heavenly Father, we thank You that we are able to meet again on this Lord’s Day to hear Your Word read and preached, to sing praises to Your Name, to share fellowship one with another and to celebrate the Lord’s Supper. We remember the Perfect sacrifice of Jesus, made to secure our redemption, and to turn us from rebels into saints. We also look forward to the return of the King of Kings and the great Marriage Feast of the Lamb which is to come.

We thank You that Your Church is made of living stones – we who were dead in sin, but whom You made alive by Your sovereign Grace, upon whom You bestowed the very faith we needed in order to believe the Good News of Salvation, rich and free but provided at infinite cost. We thank You that it was not because of any good in us that we are now Your people but only because of Your choice. And because it is all of You, we can trust You to hold us in Your hands until the very end.

### The Wider World...... and the wider Church ### 
In this wide world, Lord, we see much that needs the healing touch of Jesus, for both body and soul. We thank You for agencies such as Barnabas Fund which reports on troubles elsewhere. We pray again for their work in Myanmar among the Chin and Karen peoples currently suffering at the hands of the military regime.

As we live our lives here in submission to Your Word, Lord, we pray for our governments, for our nation and our State of Victoria. Disorder seems to be so prevalent and we see few signs of true leadership. You instituted government to commend good and to punish evil, to protect families and allow for the freedom to preach the gospel.

So much of what we see reported goes against those purposes so we pray that Your church would stand firm in these troubled times, that we might be witnesses in word and deed to the truths of Your Word, and to declare that actions contrary to Your Word will result in harm to the people of our nation and State.

Nothing is beyond Your control, and nothing escapes Your notice. As we work for the blessing of the place in which we live, we also remember that politics and government will not bring about true peace which can come only from the Prince of Peace, and the outcome of current events is in Your hands.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for needs within our number. We continue to uphold Margaret Sanders, taking stronger medication for trigeminal neuralgia. We ask You to grant wisdom and insight to her doctor and specialists as they seek to prescribe the best treatment. 

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word. We thank You for his high calling to rightly handle the Word of Truth. We pray for our own understanding as we listen and absorb the living Word. May it go deep into our hearts to change us by the work of the Holy Spirit, to make us more into the likeness of Jesus each day. As we study Your Word in community groups we pray for opportunities to live it out, and to care for one another in the grace that You supply.

Knowing that we may make our plans but You guide our ways, we pray that the work of the Kingdom may prosper as Your Word extends outward from this place, In Jesus Name, Amen.





We come now to the reading of God’s Word.

The reading is today’s passage from which Barry will preach shortly. Follow with me as we read Ezra chapter 6 verses 13 to 22.


Just before Barry preaches, let us stand to express our joy in the words of our next hymn “Join All the Glorious Names.”
