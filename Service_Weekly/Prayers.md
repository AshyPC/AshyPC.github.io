## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 9th May 2021 (Mothers Day)

__Ps 118:5‭-6__ _Out of my distress I called on the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free.
 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?_

### Thanks to God
Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are on our side and You do not abandon Your people, despite our many failings. We thank You for the blessings of common grace which You pour out on all people.

But we especially thank You that You sent Jesus on a rescue mission – to save us out of our distress. We thank You for the special grace of salvation: while we were still sinners, Jesus came as the Sinless Perfect Son of God and Son of Man to take our place and suffer the penalty which we deserved, dying in our stead so we could go free.

We thank You that You raised Him up on the third day, defeating death and sin, demonstrating that sin is an intruder upon what was Your perfect creation. We thank You that there will be an end to sin when Jesus returns visibly at the end of this era. Thereafter, we Your redeemed people, and Your restored Creation will show forth Your glory without limit, forever and ever.

### The Wider World
On this Sunday which many call Mothers Day, we thank You for our mothers, whether with us or not. We thank You for their love for us, and the care they have given us. We pray that they would continue to be living witnesses to Your love and care for Your people.

We continue to pray for the nation and the people of India, where the Covid19 virus has taken such a toll. We pray for the national and State governments as they seek to manage the crisis and keep their health systems functioning. We pray that You would strengthen and support the health workers coping with the huge numbers of infected people, and we pray for the Christian aid workers who are trying to support the people, especially in rural areas where health facilities are not at the same standard as in the cities.

### ... and the wider Church
We bring before You also the work of Samaritan’s Purse Operation Christmas Child. We pray that the shoebox appeal will result in great blessings for the children, and that the cost of transport will be met in full.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we pray for our Board of Management and give You thanks for those who have been nominated to serve. We thank You that the Board administers the property of the congregation well, and pray for continued wisdom as it carries out its work on our behalf.

We pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We pray that our fellowship continues to grow stronger as we meet each week, both in Sunday worship and in our community groups.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. May we be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that Your living Word goes deep into our hearts. Holy Spirit, we pray that You would change us so that we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word. May we grow to show the character of our Risen Lord so well that others will see Him rather than us. 

In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
