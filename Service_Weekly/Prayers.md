## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 17th August 2025

__Psalm 18:30__ 
_As for God—His way is perfect; the word of the Lord proves true; He is a shield for all those who take refuge in Him._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we can take refuge and come under Your protection. We thank You for Your grace and favour, because we have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and we are now sons and daughters of the Living God.

We acknowledge that Your ways are perfect, but our ways have been so marred by sin that we could not save ourselves. We thank You that Your Word is true, and we have been forgiven, and set free by The Eternally Begotten Son, Jesus, Who suffered and died for us.

We thank You that because He rose again and now lives forever, we can face whatever this world presents with trust in You. We thank You for the assurance of hope in a certain, glorious future, laid up for us in Heaven.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We pray for this world where so many have been blinded by an enemy of God, who has been defeated at the Cross, but who still seeks to destroy the church and take people captive. We also are aware of those who know what they do, who hate the people of God and seek to destroy them. We pray that You would strengthen Your persecuted church, and encourage those who have lost loved ones to persecution and terror. 

We pray for the young people who will eventually receive shoeboxes via Operation Christmas Child. We pray for their salvation, as they feel the impact of the love that has gone into those small gifts, an expression of Your love toward us, and passed on to them.

### Ashburton
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we endeavour to follow on the path You are leading us. As we seek a new pastor/preacher to work within Your plans for this place, we pray for the Selection Committee as they apply Your wisdom to their search, so that in the end, everything will be done according to Your will for us and for the new minister of Your Word and sacraments.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Paul’s preparation so that what he brings in his preaching today will be for our edification, encouragement and blessing. We pray that his own walk of faith will likewise be more faithful than before because of the work he has put into serving us as the minister of Your Word today.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
