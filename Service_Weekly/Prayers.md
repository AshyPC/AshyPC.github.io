## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 25th November 2018

__Hebrews 6:10-11__ 
_God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized._


### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are both Just and Merciful. We thank You that You made a world that was perfect, but even when it was spoiled by Adam's sin You persevered with Your plan from the beginning and it will be carried out to the end. 

We thank You that Jesus came to rescue us even though we were rebels who did not want to return to You, our Maker. We thank You that Jesus persevered and faced the death we deserved. His perfect sacrifice and His victorious resurrection has enabled us to return to You, to receive Your Mercy and amazingly to be adopted into a heavenly family with the assurance of being with You forever.

We see in ourselves the old nature holding us back, and we thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Who is with us daily to change us to be more and more like Jesus. We thank You Holy Spirit for Your constant Presence. 

### The World 
We understand that we are citizens of both earth and heaven, and so we pray for our State of Victoria where yesterday most voted in the election. The results will please some and not others but we pray for the incoming government to act wisely, with integrity and transparency for the good of the whole State. 

### The Church
We thank You that the Church is separate from politics but we thank You that we enjoy peaceful ways of selecting our governments. However, the church is operating within this world and we pray for Your people to remain free to uphold the Word and live out the Gospel in peace. There are many other places where it is unsafe to be a believer, and we pray for perseverance and courage for those members of the Body of Christ also.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us. We pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries and we seek Your strength and courage to do the work of the Kingdom. We look forward to the Carol Service as a means of meeting people and sharing the love of Jesus as we focus on His first coming in this Christmas season. 

We also want to pray for those who cannot be with us today. For those travelling, we pray for safe journeys and for those ill or injured we pray that Your healing hand would enable a swift recovery.

We pray for boldness in speaking of Your love, and for strength to do what is right at all times,  so that we can give an effective witness for the sure hope we hold for the future. May all that we do bring honour to the Name of Jesus, for it is in His Great Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring us our next reading today from the Gospel of Luke.
