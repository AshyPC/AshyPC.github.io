## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 21st July 2024

__Psalm 33:18-20, 22__ 
    _Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him,_
    _on those who hope in His steadfast love,_
    _that He may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine._
    _Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield._
    _Let Your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in You._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we give You thanks today, applying the words of David to our present situation, as we put our trust in Jesus, the Son of God.

Today Your church appears small, facing a large world hostile to the Truth, and we see a famine, not of food, but of the Word of Life. But we thank You that Jesus is the Living Word, the Bread of Life, Who came down from heaven, to live as we live, yet remaining without sin.

We thank You that He took the judgment that we deserved for our sin against You, paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give is His righteousness, His endless life and His Name, so that we can call ourselves “Christians” without embarrassment.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for this world where we see forces at work not only creating division but attempting to assassinate political candidates, instead of voting against them. We pray that such violence is not copied here, but that public issues may be debated respectfully and peacefully.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities to work for the good of all rather than for factions and special interests. We pray especially for a restoration of Godliness, and widespread acknowledgement of Jesus as the Prince of Peace, Lord and Saviour.

We thank You for the work of Calvin and Ruth Mathys in PNG, bringing Ruth’s language skills to the task of Bible translation, and Calvin’s engineering skills to aircraft maintenance to bless all the remote communities where MAF flies. We pray also for the work of Samaritan’s Purse and the shoebox ministry of Operation Christmas Child. We pray that the cvhildren who receive shoeboxes would know the True Gift of Jesus, given by a loving Heavenly Father to redeem the world.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to reach our local community here. May we also share the Good News of the Giver of the True Gift, the perfect Father Who loves to see people come to salvation, and be adopted into His heavenly family. We have plenty of room for new people to come, to learn of the forgiveness of their sins at the Cross, and join us in worship.

We thank You Lord for Mook, who has taken on so much extra this year. We pray that You would strengthen him, and protect him and Talia, Jethro, Amy and Judah, as we seek Your will for a new minister to join in Your work here.

We pray for those among us in need of Your healing touch, thinking especially of John McKenzie, Phil Langford and Margaret Sanders. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued witness to those around us, both as a congregation and one by one where we live, study, and work. In Jesus Precious Name, Amen.
