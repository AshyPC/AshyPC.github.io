## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 7th September 2025

__Psalm 86:6-9__ 
_Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace. In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours. All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that You listen when we call out to You.

We know that we could not be perfect as You are Perfect, for we are sinners and in trouble in this world. We thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, to save us.

We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from sin.

We thank You that we will shortly take part in the Lord’s Supper, commemorating the Cross and Resurrection, which secured our eternal salvation.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to be with us daily, to come alongside and enable us to resist temptation, to open our minds to Your Word, and to grant us wisdom as we live in this fallen world.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We pray for this world where so many live by lies, like those whom Jesus confronted, or who always seek the Truth but never seem to find it, like the Greeks in Athens, where Paul confronted their many religious idols.

We pray for those close to us, who do not know the Truth. We pray for the many churches where Your Word is faithfully preached and lived, and ask that You would strengthen Your people to stand firm but with grace, against the lies so popular today.

### Ashburton
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we also labour with our various talents and abilities in the work of the Kingdom. We pray for Russell and Bear as they serve as companion visitors to aged care residents. When those residents pass away, their relationship is cut off, and that can be painful. We ask that You strengthen them as they witness to Your faithfulness towards the aged and frail.

We pray for the Selection Committee which meets today, as they seek Your wisdom, and work to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail and we call a new minister of Your choosing, to bring us Your Word and sacraments. We pray for ourselves to support them in their work, as they serve on our behalf in what could be a lengthy process.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Douglas as he preaches today. We pray that we would be diligent hearers and do-ers of Your Word, making the most of the means of grace.


In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.

As we will shortly take part in the Lord’s Supper, let is recall the fundamentals of our faith by reciting The Apostle’s Creed:

I believe in God, the Father almighty,
      creator of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
      who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
      and born of the virgin Mary.
      He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
      was crucified, died, and was buried;
      he descended to hell.
      The third day he rose again from the dead.
      He ascended to heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
      From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
      the holy catholic* church,
      the communion of saints,
      the forgiveness of sins,
      the resurrection of the body,
      and the life everlasting. Amen.
