## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 29th December 2019 

__Rev 4:8__ _The four living creatures hovering over the throne of God do not cease to say,

"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, Who was and Who is and Who is to come."_

### Thanks to God
Father God, we come into Your Presence today acknowledging that You are Holy, the Holy One, from Everlasting to Everlasting. We also declare that You are worthy of all praise, honour, glory and majesty. When we see this in Your Word and reflect on the year closing, we are in awe at Your great grace shown to us, who are still so far from Your Holiness. You call us to be holy as You are holy, yet You have chosen to accept us in the Beloved. We thank You Jesus, as we remember Your first coming in this season, and we bow before You, looking forward to Your Second Coming as the King of Kings.

We thank You that although we were lost, You sent Jesus to find us, despite our sinful natures, and to redeem us and restore us to Your Presence. We can now declare ourselves members of the household of faith, but it is entirely by Your grace and through the complete obedience of Jesus that we continue to live under Your sovereignty.

### The World and the Church
As we review this past year, we are both saddened and encouraged, for we see that there is still much evidence of sin in our nation and more calamity still affecting many parts of this land. We pray again for relief for drought-affected areas, and for the quenching of the fires which still burn in many places. As we pray for the physical conditions, we also pray for the spiritual condition of our State and nation. We pray for our elected Parliamentarians, the Governor and Governor-General and all who servein publc office. Grant them wisdom in all their dealings, in teh issues which they must address, and we pray too for the preservation of our freedoms.

We thank You for the good things we have seen also, especially as the Christmas season closes. We pray for seeds sown in people's hearts as they were reminded in the various carols services of the real events which took place in Bethlehem.

We thank You for the work of the church and especially our own denomination this year. We pray for the many pulpits where Your Word has been preached boldly and faithfully, and ask that by Your grace that may continue even more in the coming year.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves to be faithful and true to Your Word also, as Barry and Mook preach through the coming year. 

May we have attentive ears, a ready heart to receive and a willingness to act in accordance with the truth. May we be ever growing in holiness so that we are known as people of integrity, and may we also grow in our love and fellowship one with another here. We pray that our unity in the Spirit would be enhanced and strengthened as we serve one another and the community around us, striving to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will hand over to Seng who will bring our nextreading from God's Word.
