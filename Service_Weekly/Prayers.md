## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 6th September 2020 

__Psalms 79:9-10__ _Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; And deliver us and forgive our sins for Your Name's sake. Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You always guard Your Name and the glory of Your Name. Your creation was glorious in the beginning. Even under the effects of the curse caused by Adam's sin, we see some of Your glory still. We confess that this world has rejected You, and we confess the sin of pride which keeps us from turning back to You to be forgiven, restored, healed. 

We thank You that You rescued us from the depths of our sin by sending Jesus to take our place. We thank You that it is all of Your glorious grace, that while we were still dead in sin You delivered us, and transferred us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Your Son.

We thank You that we can still worship with the help of technology and that we are still able to sing Your praises in our separated places. Being apart does not prevent us from being a united body of believers, ready to hear Your Word read and preached. 

### The Wider World ### 
We thank You that conditions in Victoria are improving as the number of reported Covid cases falls steadily each day. But we hear of fresh outbreaks in other States, and we continue to pray for our leaders and their medical advisers as they grapple with the difficulties of scaling back the restrictions. There are still restrictions on travel and life is a strain for many. 
 
### and the wider Church ###
In the wider church, we pray for Daniel and Sharon Loo and family in Thailand. May they know Your grace in increasing measure as they serve the people there. 

We particularly continue to pray for the staff and patients of Kirkbrae Aged Care, which is still operating under serious restrictions. We pray for the removal of the non-compliance notice and the exit of Eastern Health so that Kirkbrae can stand on its own feet again. 

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we give thanks that we have been so far well-protected from the virus itself. But there are other matters of health and well-being to pray for.
We give thanks for Stephanie's recovery and progressive return to work. We pray for her work colleagues to remain safe also. 
We give thanks for Russell's successful eye surgery and pray for his comfort whilst he awaits the removal of his stitches. We also pray for Jocelyn's recovery. Strengthen her daily Lord, so she can work with confidence.
We continue to pray for Daisy's full recovery from the eczema flare-up, and we give thanks for the improvement in Margaret Sanders' neauralgia.

We also uphold Barry, Mook, the musicians and the team preparing our video services. We thank You for the online prayer time before the service goes to air, and pray for more to join in. We ask for Your help and encouragement in our own times of praying for each other. May You draw us closer to Yourself daily.

In everything we do, may we strive to make known the sure hope we have in Our Lord, Jesus Christ, so that the nations no longer dare to ask "Where is their God?" For we pray all these things for the sake of the Kingdom and for the glory of the King of Kings, Amen.
