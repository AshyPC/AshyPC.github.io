## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 30th July 2017

__Psalm 26:2__ _Examine me, O Lord , and try me; Test my mind and my heart._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, You are Lord of all, You see all, and You know the end from the beginning. We live in Your Presence, and nothing can be hidden from You. But because of Your great love for us who deserve nothing more than Your justice, we can remain in Your Presence without being consumed. Therefore with David, we can dare to ask that You try us and see if there is any wicked way within. 

We thank You that whatever there is has been already dealt with at the Cross. Help us to be ever mindful of the cost of our rebellious waywardness. Help us also to be alert to temptation so that we may submit ourselves afresh to You, shelter under Your wings, and therefore see the tempter flee from us. 

### The World and the Church
We thank You that we do not face this world alone, but that You have placed us in Your Church, the Body of Christ, the guardian of the truth, where we find both encouragement and correction. We thank You for fellow believers who can help us to see where we fall short and help us to align ourselves with Your Word. We ask that You stir us up to encourage each other to "love and good works." We know that too often we have chosen the path of comfort, whereas we want to choose the path of commitment, and fuller obedience to Your Word. Grant us the strength to stand up when we would prefer to sit down, and to speak up when we would prefer to remain silent. 
 
### Ashburton
We again give thanks for Your goodness to us here in Ashburton, and for the progress each day in the work that You have set before us. We thank You for new students in the ESL ministry each week. We continue to pray for the Youth Group, the Seniors Centre and the Holmesglen Student Ministry, and for the changes we need to make to ensure that they operate successfully. 

We pray for Sue and Tim Barber as they go this week to Adelaide for the funeral of a close family friend, killed in a road accident. We pray for his family and for the driver of the car, and we ask that Sue and Tim might be able to minister Your love and compassion for the family as they grieve this sudden and tragic loss of the Dad and husband.  

In everything, Lord, we ask that whatever we do may be unto You, done in Your strength and always seeking for Your glory, in Jesus' Name we pray, AMEN. 

And now we come to the next reading from second Samuel chapter 13.
