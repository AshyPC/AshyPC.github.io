## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 25th March 2018

__Psalm 62:1-2__ 
_Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.
Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I shall never be shaken._


Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the God of rest, Who rested from the work of Creation, and gave us a day of rest. We thank You that we can come into Your Presence to praise and worship You. We thank You that we can rest securely in Your Presence every day, and yet we can enjoy a day of rest from our own work. 

We thank You that Jesus, the Eternal Son, came into our world to bring salvation to us, a salvation not brought about by our labour, but granted by You as a gift, according to Your sovereign choice and purpose, based upon His finished work on the Cross.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit to be with us Your people, to guide us, teach us and santify us daily. We thank You that it is by His enabling, rather than our own efforts, that we work in the Kingdom to obey Your Word and see Your purposes established in this world and the next.   

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world and the work of the church in extending the Kingdom. As we observe more and more attempts to restrict the Church and attack Your people, we pray that our trust would remain in the Rock Who is Christ, the returning King, and that we may continue to declare the Good News, as ambassaddors of His Kingdom.

We still see a world in which men seek wisdom in the wrong places, and yet in their confusion do not realise that there is only One to Whom they can turn for the true wisdom from above. We pray that Your church would be firm in clinging to the Truth of Your Word, and compassionate in declaring it, whether in season or out of season. May we be diligent and persevering in our search for the lost whom You are calling back to Yourself.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us as part of Your great work to win souls. Help us to demonstrate the way the Kingdom of Heaven operates, and to work within Your purposes for this area.

We pray for the collection of the Hope food bags today that the generosity of people around us may result in blessing to those who eventually receive the donated goods. And may the receivers also know that they have a Rescuer in whom they can trust, niot just for material sustenance but also for eternal life.

We pray for those who are not well, knowing that we are all subject to the weaknesses of winter chills, colds and 'flu. Sustain us we pray so that we may continue to serve. 

We pray also for travelling mercies for those of our number who are away. Keep them and bless them in their journeys, and bring them back safely in due time. 

In all these things we seek to remain faithful to Your calling and the leading of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now Theodore will bring our second reading of God's Word today, from Second Samuel 23.
