## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 2nd August 2020 

__Psalms 89:34__ _I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are faithful You keep Your covenants and fulfil Your promises. We thank You that You rescued us from the depths of our sin, as You promised to Adam and Eve in the beginning.

We thank You that we can still gather in worship with the help of modern technology and that we are still able to sing Your praises and hear Your Word read and preached. 

We thank You for the various means You have provided for us to guard our health. As we use all the means You give us, we still look to You as the true source of our spiritual and physical well-being.

### The Wider World ### 
We recognize the seriousness of conditions in Victoria as the number of reported Covid cases has escalated dramatically and that there are fresh outbreaks in other States as well. We pray for our leaders and their medical advisers as they grapple with this great surge of cases. May their efforts soon yield success so that the more severe restrictions can be rolled back.
 
### and the wider Church ###
In the wider church, we pray for one of our missionary families in Papua New Guinea - the Mathys. We give thanks that PNG has not suffered much from the virus so far, and pray that it wouldremain safe. Meanwhile the Wycliffe base at Ukarumpa has been affected by the various preventative measures put in place. We pray that things may soon return to normal so that Bible translation wok in the region can resume.

We particularly want to pray for the staff and patients of Kirkbrae Aged Care where an outbreak has occurred and some patients have been evacuated to hospital. Grant the management team and medical staff strength and endurance as they deal with this crisis whilst still giving their patients the utmost in care and compassion. We give thanks that not all patients have been affected, and that other parts of the Kirkbrae site are also free of the virus. We pray for their continued protection whilst the management and staff work to care for those who are affected.  

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for Callum and Stephanie, as Steph has tested positive, and they are in self-isolation. We thank You that Callum can continue working from home whilst caring for Steph. We pray for speedy recovery and for protection for others in the congregation.

We continue to uphold Barry, Mook, the musicians and others who prepare our video services so that we are still able to take part in worship remotely. We ask for Your help and encouragement in our own times of reading Your Word and praying for each other. May we build good practices of spiritual discipline in reading You Word, praying for each other and supporting each other. May You draw us closer to Yourself daily.

In everything we do, may we strive to make known the sure hope we have in Our Lord, Jesus Christ, for Whose glory we pray all these things, Amen.
