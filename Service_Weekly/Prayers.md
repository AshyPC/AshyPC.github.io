## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 18th May 2025

__Psalm 70:4-5__ 
_[4] May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, “God is great!”_
_[5] But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay!_

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today, aware that all our ways are known to You. We come seeking Your salvation, having set aside our failed attempts to save ourselves. You are indeed Great, Holy, Perfect and Righteous altogether.

We know that we are poor and needy, and we thank You that our salvation rests on Jesus, and His once and for all RIGHT sacrifice, not on our good works, which count as nothing in the light of Your Perfect holiness.

We thank You that Jesus took the punishment, paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give is His righteousness, His endless life. We thank You that You are our help and our redeemer, and that without His life, imparted by the Holy Spirit, we would be lost.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We pray for this world where so many do not even realise that they are lost unless they turn back to You.

We pray for the persecuted church, recognising that our difficulties are slight compared to those in Africa, suffering much persecution, destruction and hatred.

We pray for our nation which also attacks Your church and Your people, even though what we see here is so mild compared to other lands. We pray for a turnaround, so that Your Word would again be respected by most, we pray for people to see their sin and repent, and we pray that You would enable us to be faithful witnesses to Your Word of Truth.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as we seek to grow in Godliness and obedience to Your Word; we pray for our diligent study of Your Word and for perseverance in applying it to our daily lives. When we pray, we want to pray believing and trusting that You will respond. Help us to recognise Your answer when it comes, and give thanks as we see Your hand at work.

We thank You for Mook bringing Your Word to us today. We pray that his preparation will bear fruit among us in greater boldness to share the good news of our gracious loving Father, our eternal High Priest, the Lord Jesus, and our Ever-Present Guide, the Holy Spirit.

In Jesus Precious Name we ask all these things, Amen.
