## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 15th October 2017

__Psalms 86:5__ _You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you._ (David)

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today only because You are forgiving, and good, and abounding in love. We know we need forgiveness and we know that we cannot be good apart from your work within us. We thank You that Your Love is expressed towards us as those who have called to You.

### The World and the Church
We thank You for Your Church which You are building up daily. We thank You for our brothers and sisters in the faith both here and in other places. They encourage us to remain faithful to Your calling, the spur us on to love and good works, which You have set out ready for us to do, in order to serve others and spread the good news of Jesus. We thank You that Your church can still speak out and be heard in this nation. We pray again for the preservation of the definition of marriage in Australia as the postal survey concludes this week, and we await the result in November.

Heavenly Father, we thank you for our marriage relationships. We ask that You protect and strengthen them, that we will hear and apply in our lives what you teach us on marriage in Your Word. We pray for happy and strong marriages which can be examples to others, and a demonstration of the relation of Christ to His Church.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as servants in the work here. We pray Your mercy and protection for those travelling and we ask Your comfort for those in need of care and fellowship. We pray for Mook as he prepares to expound Your Word for us this morning, and we also pray for the continuation of his cross-cultural work here, especially for the opening of doors at Holmesglen TAFE. Help us to remain eager to work, despite the delays we experience, and help us to neither run ahead of Your timing nor to lag behind.  

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Nam will bring our next reading from God's Matchless Word.
