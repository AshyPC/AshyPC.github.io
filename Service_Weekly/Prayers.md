## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 18th August 2024

__Psalm 62:7-8__ 
    _On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God._
    _Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we come to You today, giving thanks that our salvation rests on You and not on ourselves, for You are the mighty Rock, our fortress. We can trust in You always, when life is smooth but even more when things are not going our way.

We confess Lord, that what we think of as smooth sailing usually means getting our own way, and in that we see our sinful pride. We thank You for Jesus Who came down from heaven, to live as we live, yet Who remained without sin, and Who went to the Cross to take away our sin.

We thank You that He took the judgment that we deserved for our sin against You, paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give is His righteousness, His endless life and so that we can share in His inheritance – that of the First Born from the Dead. By Your ordaining, we now have “an interest in the Saviour’s blood.”

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for this hurting world where we see division and violence, hatred, anger and hostility. We pray that the Prince of Peace would bring the peace we long for. It is distressing to see so much violence and rioting in the nation that pioneered unarmed policing just 200 years ago.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities to work for the good of nation. We pray especially for a restoration of Godliness in public life, and widespread acknowledgement of Jesus as the Prince of Peace, Lord and Saviour.

This month we support the work of the Bible League, especially as they work to bring Your Word to persecuted peoples. As we see the decline of visible Christian faith in our part of the world, we give You thanks that the Word of God is not restricted, and the church grows in other continents and nations. We pray for safety as they bring Your Word into places where we would fear to go.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to grow in Godliness and obedience to Your Word, so that our witness may be increasingly effective in reaching our local communities. We give thanks for newcomers whom You direct towards us. May we welcome them, and help them to put their faith fully in Jesus, and join us in worship.

We thank You Lord for Mook, who has taken on so much extra this year. We pray that You would strengthen him, and protect him and Talia, Jethro, Amy and Judah, as we seek Your will for a new minister to join in Your work here.

We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued encouragement for one another here, so that we can build each other up in our most holy faith. May that encouragement give us boldness to share the good news of our gracious loving Father, both as a congregation and one by one where we live, study, and work. In Jesus Precious Name, Amen.
