## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 74:22-23__ _Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long. Do not ignore the clamour of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that today we are able to commemmorate the fact that You answered the psalmists prayer. We thank You that Jesus endured the mocking of fools, the clamour and uproar of enemies on our behalf. 

We thank You for Jesus, Whom You raised by the same power You used to create the world in the beginning. We see that death could not hold Him, that darkness could not overcome the Light of the World for more than a few days, and even then only in order to fulfill Your supreme purposes.

We thank You Holy Spirit for Your Presence with us, in fulfillment of Jesus' promise to His original disciples. We thank You that You bring into our lives today the power, the effect of the Cross, and the full impact of the Father's forgiveness. We thank You that we are not excused as if we couldn't help being sinners, but fully forgiven, by recognising and accepting our sinful natures. Thank You that we are accepted solely because of Jesus' death and resurrection.

### The World & The Church
We thank You, Lord, for Your Church and we pray that around the world Your people would be encouraged to stand firm for the Truth of the Cross and the Resurrection. May the Church be united in this that Jesus died and that He was raised to life on the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that we bring a message of reconciliation rather than judgement.

### Ashburton
As we resume some of our activities this week, Lord, we pray for our ESL students and our EEBS, as ways to serve those in our community as well as to share with them the Good News that Jesus is alive from the dead. We remember Suzanne, still seeking work to fulfill her visa requirements.

We also pray for those amongt us in need of Your healing hand. We especially pray for Jim Gleeson and Muriel French now enjoying some respite care. May it be also a time of rest for her family who care for her most closely.

And we pray for safe travel for John & Gaye, that their trip would be relaxing and enjoyable, and that they would find good Christian fellowship on their journey.

We pray all these things Lord, knowing that You are the One Who answers, and that all the glory therefore belongs to You. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles as Gaye McKenzie brings us today's second reading from Matthew.
