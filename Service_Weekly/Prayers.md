## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 24th April 2022

__John 15:13__ 
_Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we give You thanks today, and praise Your Name because You are God Most High. We thank You for Your faithfulness – You are the Keeper of Promises, even the most costly. You promised to Adam and Eve that One would come to defeat Satan and redeem mankind from the curse of sin.

As we look back on the Easter season we remember the victory that Jesus won. We see the visible expression of Your love towards Your people – love that cost the Son His life. We remember the Resurrection, the complete defeat of death and sin. We give thanks for our release from the power of sin and the penalty which rightly belonged to us as sinners. We now look forward to the time of His ascension to glory and the establishment of the Church at Pentecost.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
Tomorrow, many will gather to remember those who have fallen in war to preserve our freedoms. We thank You for their sacrifice and pray that it was not in vain. We take up the responsibility of preserving the nation they died for, a nation built on Biblical foundations but now drifting far from You. As we approach a Federal election, we pray for Your wisdom in casting our votes for representatives who will serve to uphold Biblical standards in public and private life. May we fulfill our duty as citizens of two kingdoms to hold accountable those whom we elect to Parliament on our behalf. May they represent their electorates fairly in a calling which we disparage too easily.

In the wider world we continue to pray for the refugee situation in the Ukraine, especially for the aid workers being mobilised to help, and for the people displaced from the war zone. May they quickly find a safe haven away from the fighting.

We thank You again for Your mercy as we see the decline in Covid cases around the nation, and we give thanks for the further easing of restrictions.

This month we pray for our chaplaincy ministries, especially in hospitals and defence, but also in other areas of life as people turn to You for comfort and guidance. We thank You for the work of the Chaplaincy Committee and pray continued strength and wisdom for Suzanne as she ministers at the Royal Children’s Hospital.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for the elders and the Board as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community know the love of God, His gracious forgiveness and the joy of serving Him in restored wholeness. We pray for the Congregational Meeting next week as we take a step at a time in the process of reviatlization.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Shiun, and for Diane dealing with a variety of medical concerns. We also remember Shon’s protective visa application and continue to seek the immigration minister’s favour in granting Shon full permission to stay in Australia. We pray also for patience as such decisions are held in abeyance during this election.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. As we listen we pray for soft hearts and fresh insight, knowing that in Him we live and move and that nothing can seprate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, our LORD, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
