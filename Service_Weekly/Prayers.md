## Prayers for our unity in the work of the Kingdom 
### 2nd July 2017

__Col 1:9-10__ _... we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God ..._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
God Almighty, You are Lord of both time and eternity, and all things in our world are present to You. We acknowledge that You are infinite, but we are finite and limited to this realm of time. You know the end from the beginning, and all that You do will serve Your purposes and achieve Your goals. We have gathered today to worship You Who are far above all we can imagine, and yet You have bestowed Your love upon us.

You created this world and mankind to serve You, which is our highest purpose. Although sin intervened, today we stand redeemed by what Jesus did on the Cross, and what You did in raising him up on the Third Day. 

### The World and the Church
We thank You that You planned for Your people to be united, but also to be wise in the ways of heaven, rather than the ways of the world. We thank You for Your Church, Your witness to a world that seeks for true purpose, yet refuses to look in the right direction. We pray with Paul that Your people would be filled with the knowledge of Your will along with spiritual wisdom and understanding. May the Church represent Her Lord in a worthy manner, even when enemies attack it unmercifully. May it please You in all respects, may it bear fruit in every good work that You call upon it to do.

We pray today for Your persecuted Church, where Your people suffer daily. We remember groups like MERF, Barnabas Fund, Pioneers and many others working in dangerous circumstances. We may not have personal knowledge of what Your people are going through, but we thank You that we are shielded here and we pray Your protection for those who are not.

### Ashburton
We thank You again for the joining of Ashburton and South Camberwell congregations into one. We pray that we may all grow in our knowledge of You and Your purposes, so that we all seek to serve Jesus as we increase in our knowledge of God.

We pray for our various needs, knowing that You supply all our needs as individuals - whether spiritual or material. As we grow to know each other in closer fellowship, we pray that You would guide us in praying for each other, supporting one another and encouraging one another towards the goal and purpose of "bearing fruit in every good work". 

We pray for Your Presence in our homes and workplaces, our schools and our leisure activities. We pray that in all circumstances and places we may be purposeful witnesses of the new kingdom of heaven, so that others may see that we triumph only through Jesus. For it is in His Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Nam to bring our next reading from second Samuel chapter 10.
