## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 28th April 2019
__John 15:13__ _Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we gather in Your Presence today, remembering that Jesus laid down His life for His friends and also for us, who were His enemies but who became His friends and members of the family of heaven by Your sovereign grace alone.

Last week we focused on the Resurrection, which demonstrated that Jesus conquered sin and death, and now He lives forever. On Thursday we and most of the community remembered the words which John wrote about Jesus, and commemorated the many thousands who gave their lives to defend our country and enable us to live in freedom even today.

We thank You for the freedoms and the peace we enjoy and pray that we would understand how precious is the gift that they have given. May we not take it for granted but always seek to preserve, improve and pass on to the next generation the heritage we have received.

### The World and the Church
We are saddened by yet another terrorist attack which has taken hundreds of innocent lives in Sri Lanka. We pray for the families of the victims, for the injured and for the medical teams working to save lives and attend to the injuries in hospitals all over Colombo. 

For this world, Lord, we pray for a realisation that this kind of violence is not of merely human origin, is not just because of differences between people. Rather, it is a spiritual sin problem, not open to a human solution. It needs to be dealt with by the power of the Cross and Resurrection. We pray that Your Church would be bold to proclaim this truth in word and deed. May we demonstrate the Truth in our lives together so that the world may see and understand that Jesus is the One promised, and sent by You to be the Saviour of the world. 

Within Australia, Lord, we pray for our leaders and Parliamentary candidates. We talk about "fighting the election" but we thank You that differences are respected and we pray that the campaign may be conducted peacably, honourably and with respect, focussing on the real issues facing our nation. We pray  that those MPs who are elected would serve for the good of the whole country rather than for sectional interests only.  

Within the wider Presbyterian church we pray for the Brown family and for Heather, as they grieve the passing of Ian. We thank You that his work here is done and he is now at rest in Your Presence.  Comfort the family in their grief and bless them with the spiritual and practical support of their fellow believers in the Rochester church and elsewhere at this time.   

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We pray for the closeness of fellowship one with another, so that we too may demonstrate Your love and the fact that You sent Jesus into this world as the One and Only Saviour, our Redeemer.

In His Great Name we pray, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring our second reading for today.
