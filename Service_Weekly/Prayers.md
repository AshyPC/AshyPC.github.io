## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 9th June 2024

__1 John 5:1-5__ 
    _Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well._
    _This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands._
    _In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,_
    _for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith._
    _Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we give You thanks today, taking to heart the words of John, as we seek to build our lives on the foundation of faith in Jesus, the Son of God. John wrote to a small body of believers facing a huge empire of people hostile to the strange idea of God as Man dying and rising again. Today Your church still faces a world hostile to the Truth, and we find ourselves again in the minority, on the defensive. But we thank You for this reminder that Jesus has already overcome the world, and the devil, and death itself, so that our faith can be strong despite all we see around us.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for this world where we see forces at work creating division instead of working for peace. We thank You for the work of Lazlo & Eva Mihalyi seeking to minister in churches which give aid to the homeless and the refugees from the fighting in Eastern Europe. We thank You for Lazloâ€™s successful eye operation, and we pray for his continued recovery and ongoing health, so that they may return to their work with churches and ministers, so that the preaching of the gospel can be fully restored.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities to work for the good of all rather than for factions and special interests.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to reach our local community here. We thank You for the continuing work of Revitalization, for the unity we have in our vision to see Jesus lifted up, both here and elsewhere. We pray for opportunities to witness to Your great love, and Your desire that more and more would honour Him as their Lord and Saviour. We have plenty of room for new people to come, to learn of the forgiveness of their sins at the Cross, and join us in worship.

Help us to welcome all who come, that these seats may be filled, that we can grow in faith as well as numbers so that we can send out strong believers who will carry Your Word to others in need of Your saving grace.

We pray for those among us in need of Your healing touch, thinking especially of John McKenzie with his long course of treatment and Marg Sanders. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued witness to those around us, both as a congregation and one by one where we live, study, and work. In the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
