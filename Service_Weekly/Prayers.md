## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 16th November 2025

**Psalm 17:6** 
_I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You listen when we call to You, and so we are encouraged to bring our pleas to You.

We know that we are sinners and in trouble in this world. We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from sin. We thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, to save us from Your righteous judgement upon sin.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to carry our Words to You even when we don’t know how to say what is on our hearts. We thank You that He also remains with us daily, to strengthen us against temptation. We pray that we would not resist His work, so that we grow in godliness daily, and stand firm in Your strength against the wiles of the enemy.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for this world where so many live without a sure foundation in the Truth, drifting with little purpose, unaware of the eternal hope available to all who trust in Jesus. We pray that our words and our lives demonstrate that we put our trust in Jesus death at the Cross, and His resurrection from the dead and His eternal reign in glory.

We pray for our nation, where last week Remeberance Day passed with only a little recognition of what it takes to ensure we live quiet lives, free to share the Good News, and to gather in worship without interference or the terrorism that afflicts Your people elsewhere.

We pray for the many churches where Your Word is faithfully preached and lived, and ask that You would strengthen Your people to stand firm but with grace, against the lies so popular today. We see Your church beset by enemies outside and division inside, but still growing as You add daily those who are being saved.

**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we also labour with our various talents and abilities in obedience to Your calling. We pray for continued wisdom for the Selection Committee, working to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail and the work of the Kingdom continues according to Your plan and purposes.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Mook as he preaches today. We pray that we would hold firmly to the sure anchor of our souls, and so endure to the end, confident that one day we will see the return of our King of kings.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
