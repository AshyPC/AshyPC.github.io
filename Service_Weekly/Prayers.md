## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 29th January 2023

__1 Thess 5:16-18__ 
_Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father we come before You today to give You thanks and praise. We thank You that because of Your salvation, seen from the beginning, promised to Adam and Eve, fulfilled by Jesus Himself, we can rejoice always for the release we have from the guilt, the power and the penalty of sin. Whatever our situation today, Your perfect and complete redemption deals with our deepest needs.

Our Lord Jesus surrendered the glories of heaven to come down to this earth. When He had fulfilled that mission, He ascended to the throne again so that He could prepare a place for us in Your Presence. His sacrifice provided true righteousness in place of our degradation. We can rejoice freely because He has fulfilled the Perfect Law, which we failed to do.

We thank You that we are now free to walk in newness of life and take part in the work You have prepared for us in advance.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where so many remain in darkness and where so much is opposed to Your will and purpose. Yet we see glimpses of the glory of Your original creation, and long for the restoration of all things, when Jesus returns.

We pray for Your Church, again giving thanks for the work of the gospel which continues despite interruptions and oppression in many places around the world. We thank You for news from Calvin & Ruth Mathys, recovering after last year’s earthquake, and give thanks that Ruth is making excellent progress after surgery on her broken ankle.

We pray for the Church here also, where Your purposes are unstoppable, even if we do not see much in the way of visible “results.” We pray again for Matt and Kate Vinicombe and family as they persevere after the road accident, and we thank You for the excellent medical care Kate is receiving in the Austin Hospital.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here in Ashburton, and we continue to pray for the Revitalization program. We pray for restoration of the health of Margaret, Diane, Shiun, for Russell and Jocelyn taking a break, and for Steph and Callum, as school resumes for the new year. We also pray for refreshing for Barry and Suzanne as they continue their break for another week.

We give thanks for Mook as he preaches Your Word today. We thank You for the guidance of the Holy Spiirt in his preparation, and we pray that we too will know Your Holy Spirit guidance as we hear and obey Your teaching, so that we bring honour to the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
