## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 20th April 2025 Easter Sunday

__Revelation 15:3-4__ 
_[3] And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations!_
_[4] Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”_

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we can gather joyfully today after the apparent tragedy of Friday, when to our ordinary eyes all seemed lost. We thank You for the sacrifice of the Perfect Lamb Who declared from the Cross “It is finished!” and Who entrusted Himself into Your hands so that Perfect eternal righteousness could be revealed. The Resurrection is Your declaration that our sin has been dealt with finally and fully, and the way back into Your holy presence is now wide open for all who believe.

We thank You that we have been released from the bondage to sin and can surrender our self-will to You, King of the nations and righteous ruler of our lives.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
With our natural eyes we look at this world and see so many who do not acknowledge the King of the Nations. As they scoffed at the cross, so many today still scoff at the claims of the Gospel. We continue to pray for the return of the Prince of Peace Who will bring the peace the world longs for.

We also continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, as the opponents of the nation of Israel again choose not to negotiate for peace but to continue to wage a tragic war.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We ask for wisdom as we ponder our responsibility to vote for Federal representatives soon. We pray that the Parliament will pass laws for the peace and good government of our nation, and that we may lead peaceful and quiet lives in all Godliness and holiness. We pray for good candidates, who will act with integrity in the service of the people. We especially thank You for those candidates who are believers, and ask that You strengthen them as they face glaring scrutiny during the election campaign. May they make their public stand with dignity and grace, bringing honour to Your Name.

### Ashburton
As well as our public witness, we pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We continue to pray for Alan Freer, as he progresses in his rehabilitation, and w thank You for the medical care we enjoy in this nation. We also pray for our study groups, as they learn from Your Word in our Hebrews series. Grant us clear minds to understand the meat of Your Word, and faithful hearts to live out the faith daily before a watching world. 

We thank You for Yuvi bringing Your Word today, and  ask that we ponder the great gift of grace and mercy You have poured out upon us in the New Creation, resulting from the victory of the Cross and the Resurrection. Help us as we take the eternal perspective, and share the hope that we have as we look to see the Revelation to John fulfilled when Jesus returns.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
