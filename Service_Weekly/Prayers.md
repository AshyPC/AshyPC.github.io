## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 15th June 2025

__Psalm 70:4__ 
_May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you!_
_May those who love your salvation say evermore, “God is great!”_

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we who deserve judgment have received mercy instead. We thank You for the sacrifice of the Perfect Lamb Who slain for our salvation. We confess that we are lost apart from Jesus sacrifice on the Cross, for we realise too well, that we cannot save ourselves.

We thank You that we have been released from the bondage to sin and can surrender our self-will to You, King of the nations and righteous ruler of our lives.

We thank You that You have planted in us a desire to seek You, and now we find our joy in Your presence.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
Each week as we look at the news which seems to go from bad to worse, we wonder at the reckless way nations oppose nations, and wars seem to never cease. We pray for Jesus return as the sure, the only way that this world will truly know peace.

We pray also for the persecuted church – the news may not bew on our televisons, but we know there are enemies of Your people in so many places: Mozambique, Myanmar, Pakistan and Ukraine. We pray for the church in Romania and Hungary where Lazlo and Eva Mihalyi have been working to support refugees fleeing the conflict next door.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We thank You for the work of local missions and remember Blue Moose working to bring the hope of the gospel to St Arnaud. We also pray for the work of PIM bringing the gospel message to remote parts of our land, through patrol ministries, and part time missionaries such as Colin and Ann Morrow in Mildura, and Michacel and Jemima McNair in Mt Magnet. Grant them the strength to persevere, even when they don’t see much fruit from their work.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We thank You for the working bee and the results, both in our fellowship together, and in the work of maintaining the property we use to minister the gospel in this place.

We pray for those of our number who cannot be with us, especially Diane, recovering from a bad fall, now in hospital with a broken shoulder. We continue to pray for Alan Freer, as he makes steady progress with his rehabilitation. We also pray for our study groups, as they learn more of Jesus in our Hebrews series.

We thank You for Paul Jung, bringing Your Word today, and for his preparation as guided by Your Holy Spirit. May we also know Your Presence today as we hear, understand and put into action, the teaching we are about to receive. In all these things we seek to lift up Jesus, for it is in His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
