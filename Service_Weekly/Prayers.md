## Prayer of Thanksgiving for Christmas Day

## 11th February 2024

__Psalm 23:4, 8__ 
    _4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,_
    _  I fear no evil, for You are with me;_
    _  Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me._
    _8 Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life,_
    _  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever._

#Thanks to God#
O Lord, we gather today, encouraged by the words of David. Whether we have walked this path before or not, we recognise that this valley is a shadow and we need fear no evil because of Your Presence with us. We take comfort from Your Presence; we trust in Your goodness and mercy, even when we pass through dark times.

We thank You for Jesus Who is the Resurrection and the Life. We thank You for the sure hope we have because He died, rose again, ascended to heaven and is seated at Your right hand. We thank You for the promised Holy Spirit, Who is with us as the Comforter and Guide into all truth.

#The Wide World... and the Wider Church#
Lord, we look at our world with sadness at the constant focus on bad news, of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, of missing persons and Kings with cancer, of wars and rumours of wars.

We pray for the safety of people in the area of the volcanic eruption, as we pray for the King undergoing treatment. We remember that in this sin-affected world, wars will fought, but we continue to pray for peace, especially the peace of Jerusalem.

Despite all the bad news we see and hear, we thank You for the Good News of salvation in Jesus, for Your Word which informs our minds and hearts, and for Your Church which has upheld the truth delivered once for all to the saints throughout history. We pray that You would continue to strengthen Your people daily as we witness to the Truth of Jesus, even in these times when the sober Truth is out of favour, while the dramatic and novel grab all the attention.

#Ashburton#
We pray for ourselves as we come to terms with the changes taking place here. We thank You for the appointment of our Interim Moderator, Rev Dr. Douglas Milne. We thank You that Jesus commanded us to remember His death and resurrection at the communion table, and we look forward to taking part in that later in this service.

We thank You for the support of the Presbytery as we recognise that Jesus is still building His church and has called us to join with Him in this task. We pray that we would continue to work and witness to the Good News of Jesus. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued support and encouragement, one with another. We remember those among us who are unwell or struggling, and pray that You would restore them and sustain them, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
