## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 26th September 2021 (after Grand Final Day)

__2 Corinthians 4:17‭-‬18__ _For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are our faithful God, Who has called us to an eternal future in Your glorious Presence. We thank You that, although we live in this limited and limiting present day, we look forward with confidence granted by the presence of the Holy Spirit, to an eternal future, when our fellowship with You and each other will not be hindered in any way.

We thank You for the modern means we have available to keep in touch and to participate in different ways in worship, and we ask for a fresh awareness of how momentary and light are our present afflictions.

We know that we live in a fallen,world with lots of bad news, and it is so easy to look at ourselves and become discouraged, to think that our present troubles are too big to deal with. But when we look to Jesus instead, the One Who came to pay the penalty for sin, and to give us the free gift of life, we give thanks for the Eternal perspective. His victory gives us a sure hope which overcomes our discouragements.

### The Wide World 
We now have confidence to pray for this wider world where suffering abounds but does not have the final word. We continue to pray for the believers in Afghanistan, who are in grave danger from the resurgence of terrorism there.

We also pray for the persecuted believers in Nigeria, Pakistan, India, Myanmar and elsewhere, who do not receive any recognition, who are not “newsworthy” but who are suffering far more than we have known here. Grant them grace as they share in the sufferings of Christ our Lord for the fact that they refuse to renounce their faith in Him.

### ... and in the wider Church
We pray for Your Church as lockdowns continue both here in Victoria and interstate. We pray that Your Church would remain strong in the face of the limitations imposed on daily life. We are concerned and distressed to see violence at protest gatherings and pray for all those injured in the clashes.

We pray that the work of Your church might continue despite the restrictions, and that Your people may be ready to shine with the eternal hope we have in You. We ask that You would enable us to strengthen our bonds of fellowship and encourage one another. May those around us see the love of Jesus shining through us and look for that eternal weight of glory of which Paul writes.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You that You sustain us day by day. As we do so, we thank You for the progress made by Margaret, Barbara and Diane. We pray also for Shiun recovering again from stroke and we continue to uphold Aashs’s mum in India.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. Help us to see what we need to do to live Godly lives in a world which does not acknowledge You but rather worships human endeavour in the sporting arena.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.
