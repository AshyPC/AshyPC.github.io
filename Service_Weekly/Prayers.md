## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 7th April 2024

__Psalm 97:11-12__ 
    _“Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart._
    _Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name._

__Thanks to God__

O Lord, we come before You today, lifted up by the words of the Psalmist, for You are Light and in You is no darkness. We thank You that Jesus is the Light of the world, Who is risen to bestow upon us His righteousness in place of our filthy rags of sinfulness. So we rejoice, trusting in Your promise to complete that good work in us, which began when You saved us.

We thank You for Jesus Who lives and reigns in heaven with You, and Who intercedes for us before Your throne of grace. We thank You that the Holy Spirit has come to be our comforter, our guide, and our teacher. We thank You for Your Word which is a sure foundation, the place where we find that assurance of the eternal hope we have because Jesus won the victory, and defeated the grave.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__

Lord, we look at our broken world where people ask for a sign, seek salvation in all the wrong places, not knowing that You have already provided in full via the finished work of Jesus on the Cross.

We again pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the safety of the nation of Israel as it defends itself in the midst of irrational hostility which has broken out around the world.

We pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities, to apply Your Word rather than mere human wisdom to the perplexing issues they confront, so that they govern wisely and well for the good progress of this wide brown land we call our home.

We pray for our remote and indigenous communities, and we yearn for true reconciliation through the work of the Gospel, and a move of the Holy Spirit. We pray for unity in the shadow of the Cross and the light of the empty tomb. We thank You for those who are already saved according to Your Word, sharing the Good News, and holding to the true hope as they look for Jesus return, just as we are here.

We thank You for Your people who go where we can’t reach – and we pray again for the work of Samaritan’s Purse. We pray for the shoeboxes to carry Your love to the children who receive them, and the message of salvation they receive through Operation Christmas Child.

__Ashburton (Communion Day)__

We pray for ourselves as we seek to reach our local community here. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued witness to those around us, where we live, study, and work. We thank You that today we celebrate the Lord’s Supper as a remembrance of Your great grace to us, so that we may reflect the light of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
