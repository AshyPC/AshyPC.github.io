## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 2nd November 2025

**Lamentations 3:40-41** 
_[40] Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the Lord!_
_[41]Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:_

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that Your anointed prophet, Jeremiah, expressed his sadness at the need for judgement, because Your chosen people had sinned grievously. But his words give us great encouragement as we read them today. We can examine ourselves, test our ways and return to You because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the Cross and His resurrection to life again on the third day.

We thank You that we can lift our hands and our hearts to You, for You hear from heaven, and You forgive us and restore us in righteousness. Today we will celebrate the Lord’s Supper as a remembrance, as a present reality of Your grace and mercy to us, and as a future hope for its fulfillment in the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, when He returns to claim His spotless Bride.

We thank You also for the Presence of the Holy Spirit, testifying that we are Your children, and fellow-heirs with Christ of all the promises of heaven.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
With this sure hope in our hearts, we pray for this world where so many live blindly, not knowing who Jesus is, not knowing that they are lost in sin, just as we were before You reached down to rescue us. We pray for the persecuted church, for believers in many places who suffer direct opposition, personal attacks and the destruction of all they might have in this world, as they continue to name the Precious name of Jesus, their Saviour.

We pray for the work of Bible League, bringing Bibles to those suffering persecution, and for Samaritan’s Purse taking shoeboxes to children in remote parts of this world, so that they and their families may hear the Good News of Your merciful release from sin, and a sure hope for the future.

**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we labour in our local mission field. We thank You for our various talents and abilities and pray for courage to apply them in the work of the Kingdom. We pray for opportunities to share the Good News that Jesus saves, and that we would take up those opportunities when they show up.

We pray for the Selection Committee which meets today, as they seek Your wisdom, and work to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail and we call a new minister of Your choosing, to bring us Your Word and sacraments. We pray for ourselves to support them in their work, as they serve on our behalf in what could be a lengthy process.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, John McKenzie and others affected by illness or injury. We pray for Clarissa, facing another operation in a week or so, for her parents as they face the stress of watching and waiting for the results, and for Raymond and Jessie as they support the family at this critical time.

We thank You for Your Word, and for Douglas as he preaches today, and as he leads us in the Lord’s Supper later. We pray that we would be diligent hearers and do-ers of Your Word, making the most of the means of grace. As we partake of a familiar part of congregational life, we pray that You would open our eyes to see the wonders of Your grace and mercy afresh, because they are new every morning.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
