## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 11th September 2022

__Dan 2:20-21__ 
_Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.
He changes times and seasons; he deposes kings and raises up others
He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come before You today, praising You because You are the all-wise, all-powerful God of Creation. Yet, we marvel that Jesus came to this earth humbly, to do Your will, not His own. As we have just read from Your Word, He gave us an example of humility by washing His disciples’ feet. Then He secured for us Your grace, mercy and peace through His death on the Cross and His resurrection.

We thank You that today we celebrate the Supper as a remembrance of Your love and we rejoice in the fact that we welcome so many into full membership of this congregation.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we thank You for the long life of Your servant, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Thank You that throughout her life, her hope in You remained steadfast, as the true King Who remains the same yesterday, today and forever. Comfort all who mourn her death: her family, her subjects, and all who admired and respected her.

We also pray for our new earthly sovereign, Charles III. Grant him great wisdom and humility as king. May he know that he submits to a higher authority, that You are the one "who changes times and seasons; You remove kings and set up kings" as Daniel reminds us. May we all keep our eyes fixed on You as the source of all hope and comfort in these times of change, as the One who "will reign forever... to all generations."

### Ashburton
We continue to pray for the Revitalization program as we work to see our calling and our vision take shape, so that we can be a more effective channel for Your grace and mercy to reach this community. We aim not to keep this secret to ourselves, but we want others to see and know for themselves that You are truly the God Who cares for His people.

We pray for those among us who need Your healing hand, especially remembering Diane and her heart condition and Shiun’s slow recovery. We pray also for John McKenzie who has tested positive for Covid, even as we acknowledge that generally the virus has abated significantly. We give thanks also that Margaret Sanders in the UK has enjoyed her visits to family, and that all her travels have been safe and uneventful.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches today. May he expound clearly Your Word so that we grow in our undertanding of the church and our place in Your work here. This we pray in the Name of our Lord Jesus, our humble King of Kings, for Whose Kingdom we work in the strength You give us, Amen.
