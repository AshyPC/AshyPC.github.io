## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 28th December 2025

**Psalm 28:8-9** 
_[8] The Lord is the strength of His people; He is the saving refuge of His anointed._
_[9] Oh, save Your people and bless Your heritage! Be their shepherd and carry them forever._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that we can come into Your Presence, despite our weaknesses and failings. 

We know that we are not perfect as You are Perfect, for we are sinners and in trouble in this world. We thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, to save us.

We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from sin.

We thank You that we can take refuge in You, despite all the troubles we see in this world.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for the persecuted church, especially in places like Nigeria, Cambodia, and Myanmar. We ask for Your protection of the people, courage to persevere in loving their enemies, and endurance to flee from terrorists, knowing that Joseph and Mary also fled, taking Jesus to safety away from the threat of king Herod. 

We pray for churches around the world beset by pressures from the unbelieving societies around them. May they find strength in You and Your Word to resist the pressure to conform to the world’s standards rather than to Your holiness.

As our governments take steps to confront anti-Semitism in our nation, we pray for Godly wisdom rather than human pragmatism, for unbiased enforcement of the laws against riots and violence. We continue to pray for the recovery of those injured and wounded in the Bondi Beach attacks, and for our communities to defend the freedoms we take for granted, so that Jewish people may not have to live under a cloud of fear. We pray for churches where Your Word is faithfully preached and lived, and ask that You would strengthen Your people to stand firmly against terrorism and unreasoning hatred.

We pray for those close to us, who do not know the Truth. We especially pray for those who came to the Carols on the Lawn, that the words they heard in song and talk and teaching, may sink in, may touch their hearts and connect with their needs, so that they seek You, and come to Jesus. 

**Ashburton**
We pray for our congregation here at Ashburton, thanking You for our fellowship one with another. We especially remember those who can’t be with us. We pray for Russell and Jocelyn, that You strengthen them as they recover, and as we await news from their medical tests. We ask You to grant John perseverance as he undegoes this lengthy course of cancer treatment. We lift up Levi, and Steph and Callum, as he develops strength in his muscles day by day. Grant them all endurance and perseverance as he takes a step at a time, a day at a time, being guided by the medical team working to adapt his medication as they watch his progress.

We pray also for Alan and for Diane as they progress with their recoveries and reconstructed limbs. We stand amazed at the medical marvels we see in their respective treatments.

As we come to the end of a calendar year, we acknowledge that our times are in Your hands, and we ask You to grant us patience as we pray for the Selection Committee in the work of seeking the man of Your choosing to lead Your work here. Grant them Your wisdom, and lead them in their deliberations to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail. We pray for ourselves to support them in their work, as they serve on our behalf in what could be a lengthy process.

We thank You for Your Word, and for Mook as he preaches today. We pray that we would be diligent hearers and do-ers of Your Word, making the most of the means of grace.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
