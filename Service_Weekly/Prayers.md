## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 24th August 2025

__Psalm 4:3__ 
_But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for Himself; the Lord hears when I call to Him._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that You call us to hear Your voice, to read and heed Your written Word, but we also thank You that You encourage us to speak to You, for You are listening.

We acknowledge that on our own we could not be godly, for we are sinners who need someone else to save us. We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from sin by Jesus, Who suffered and died for us, then rose to life again to grant us His righteousness.

We thank You that You have declared us godly, and drawn us to Your throne of grace, where You hear us when we call.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
With confidence then, we pray for this world where so much is wrong, where injustice seems to win, where the truth is shunned and where violent people attack Your church.

We pray for the many places where war rages, and refugees flee the conflicts. We thank You for Your faithful people who minister Your love to those fleeing, in both practical and spiritual ways. We pray that You would strengthen them and provide for them so they may continue to serve the refugees.

But we also give You thanks for the spread of the Good News, which is rarely if ever reported in our news bulletins. We thank You for the work of MAF and especially remember Calvin & Ruth Mathys working in PNG, each labouring to see the Name of Jesus lifted up and people come to true faith in Him.

### Ashburton
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we also labour with our various talents and abilities in the work of the Kingdom. We pray for the Selection Committee which meets today, as they seek Your wisdom, and work to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail and we call a new minister of Your choosing, to bring us Your Word and sacraments. We pray for ourselves to grow in the knowledge of Jesus, so that we can share the Good News wherever we go in our daily walk.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, MarJo and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Mook’s preparation so that what he brings in his preaching today will lead to growth in spiritual maturity and service bvoth to one another and to people who don’t know Your salvation - yet. 

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
