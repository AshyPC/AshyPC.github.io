## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 3rd July 2022

__James 5:17-18__ 
_Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we give You thanks and praise today, as we prepare to share in the communion table. We thank You also for Shon’s declaration of his faith in You and his trust in Jesus for his salvation, as we welcome him into membership today. We praise You for the eternal provision of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us, so that we might have new life and a new eternal inheritance. We thank You for the fellowship of the saints and the work of the Holy Spirit Who binds us together. We thank You that we are all Abraham’s offspring, heirs of the same eternal promise, made possible by the perfect work of Jesus in the Cross and the Resurrection.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we continue to pray about the war and refugee situation in the Ukraine, which does not look like being resolved anytime soon. We also give thanks for the quiet work of salvation which continues without fanfare but which makes for great rejoicing in heaven.

We pray for our nation in the middle of winter, yet suffering a drought of the Word. We long to see churches filled and a nation turning back to You. As Elijah prayed for rain so we pray for spiritual rain and refreshing for this dry continent.

We thank You for the churches where Your Word is preached faithfully week by week, but also pray. for more ministers of Your Word who will bring sound teaching, so that believers come to salvation and are then nurtured in their faith. We thank You for our Colleges which train Godly men and equip them to fulfill Your calling upon them.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray for the elders, the Board and the leadership team working on our Revitalization program, as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community won into the Kingdom and serving Him in restored wholeness.

We pray also for the Church Camp coming up real soon. May it be a time of rich blessing and fellowship. We pray for Peter Sorenson as he prepares to lead the teaching program.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness as we continue to pray for Shiun and for Diane as she continues to deal with persistent health problems. Guide her doctors as they prepare her for an operation in the coming weeks.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches today. May Your Word be always fresh and alive to our hearing. As the people of Israel responded to Elijah, we pray also that we would respond heartily to Your Word and remain diligent and faithful, day by day. And so we pray in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, Who reigns over all the affairs of man, Amen.
