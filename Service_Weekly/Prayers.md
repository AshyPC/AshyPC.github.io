## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 11th January 2026

**Psalm 34:4** 
_[4] I sought the Lord, and He answered me, And delivered me from all my fears._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You answer when we seek You, for You are the Only True God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, saviour of all Who put their trust in You.

We know that we are sinners and in trouble in this world, and we thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, to save us.

We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from sin.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to be with us daily, to come alongside and enable us to resist temptation, to open our minds to Your Word, and to grant us wisdom as we live in this fallen world.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for this world where strange events leave us baffled, where injustice, violence and terrorism leave us angry and frustrated that Your ways are denied, and where truth is twisted beyond recognition, so that we don’t know who to trust.

We thank You for Your church, where truth prevails, but we pray for those churches where Your Word is not held high. We see our young people being swayed by modern ideologies which are variations on Satan’s original lie “Has God really said…?”. We give thanks for the work of the Blue Moose mission, and the progress with young people in St Arnaud. Thank You for those turning back to Your Word, and responding to the testimonies of the team who give You the glory for Your work in their lives. We pray that the fruit of their ministry would take root and remain to bless future generations also.

We again pray for our nation, giving thanks that so many were shocked by the tragedy at Bondi Beach, and have been calling for a Royal Commission to bring a thorough understanding of the whole truth behind the unprovoked attacks. We pray that exposing the causes would lead to a rejection of such terrorism as we have seen, and a return to godliness in the Australian way of life.

**Ashburton**
As we set ourselves toward the new year, we pray for our work here in Ashburton. We ask You to lead us in fulfilling Your purposes for this area, that souls would be saved, that lives would be restored, that this community would know Your grace and mercy, expressed through our increasing fruitfulness as we obey You more and more each day.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, Russell and Jocelyn, John McKenzie, and others affected by illness or injury.

We thank You for Your Word, and for Ps. Dong as he preaches today. We pray that as we  hear we would make those changes in our lives which will lead to more fruitful service each day. In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
