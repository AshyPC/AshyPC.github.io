## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 27th April 2025 post-Anzac Day

__John 15:13 KJV__ 
_Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that we can meet here today because Jesus laid down His life for His friends, and then took it up again to complete His victory over sin and death. We also thank You that others laid down their lives to defend this nation and protect our free way of life, built originally on the foundation of Your Word.

We thank You that Your Word abides forever, even though today our nation has mostly turned its back on You, neglecting Your provision, despising the Cross, while still seeking the salvation we all need, for we have all sinned and fall short of Your Perfect glory. We all are not eligible for heaven until we surrender our self-will and submit to the Lordship of Jesus, the King of kings, Who is enthroned at Your right hand.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
On Friday last, many Australians and New Zealanders commemorated the service men and women who died to defend our nations and the freedoms we so easily enjoy. Not many of them know the true freedom from sin which we know through the work of You Holy Spirit in our lives. We pray for a revival of Your Word, for a hunger among the people around us, so that they might turn back to You.

In this election time we ask for wisdom as we ponder our responsibility to vote for Federal representatives next Saturday. We pray that the Parliament will pass laws only for the peace and good government of our nation. We pray for good candidates, who will act with integrity in the service of the people. We pray also for integrity in public life, for diligence in service, and for proper accountability as representatives who are meant to act on behalf of the voters.

### Ashburton
Here we pray for ourselves as we build each other up in the faith, showing forth the great grace and mercy You have shown to us in Jesus. We pray that we also would live uprightly, persevering in all that we do, holding to what is right and pure, commendable and excellent. We continue to pray for Alan Freer, as he progresses in his rehabilitation, and for Levi as he adjusts to his medication again. Grant him rest to allow him to grow steadily stronger, and we pray for Steph and Callum to be at rest in You, as they raise him in Godliness according to Your will.

We pray for the work here, as we pray for one another, hear Your Word preached so that we prepare ourselves to share the Good News with others. Lead us in our study groups, as we learn from Your Word in our Hebrews series.

We thank You for Sam and Dhruti and the Kingdom work they have done. Guide them in all wisdom as they seek Your will for the next work to which You will call them.

We thank You for Jordan bringing Your Word today, and ask the Holy Spirit to apply it so that we can be ambassadors for Christ to a watching world. 

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
