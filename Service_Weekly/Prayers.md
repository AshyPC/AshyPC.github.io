## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 106:47-48__ _Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy Name and glory in Your praise._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that we belong to You twice over - You are our Maker, and You are our Saviour. 

We thank You that You saved us for Your purposes - to give You thanks and praise and to magnify the Name of Jesus Christ, God the Son, the second Person of the Trinity. 

We thank You that Jesus became one of us, became one **with us** to bridge the gulf that separated us from You. He came to seek and save the lost, even if we didn't realise that we were lost in sin.

We thank You, Holy Spirit, for bringing us back from death to life, away from our rebellion and back to submitting ourselves to the authority of God, and we thank You for placing us within the Body of Christ so that we may encourage one another to continue in the faith, so that we all may bring You honour and praise, both now on this earth, and later when all the saints are gathered in the great throne room of heaven.

### The World & The Church
Today, many are honouring mothers and celebrating motherhood. We thank You that You gave us the family, and we know that Jesus honoured His parents. 

Paul commended Timothy's mother and grandmother for their consistent instruction in the true faith. Today and every day, we give You thanks for our mothers, near or far away, with us or departed.

For our church, Lord we also want to pray that You would grant us a greater fervour to seek out those not yet a part of Your kingdom, so that there are more and more from every tribe and nation to give You praise as the Psalmist encourages. 

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, Lord, we thank You for calling us to be a part of Your kingdom work for the people of this area. We thank You for the results of "Hope For Booroondara", and pray that everything collected will be used to bless others. We pray for the people we met, and give thanks for all those who gave.

We pray for Ashley and the baby she is expecting. Please keep them both safe and well, and we pray for a trouble-free delivery in due time. 

And we also pray for those in need of Your healing hand: Jim Gleeson, Muriel French and Sue Barber in particular. 

Finally, Lord, we pray that whatever You lead us to do day by day to honour the Name of Jesus, we can do it to the best of our ability, knowing that we are sharing Good News of eternal value. We thank You that wherever we go the Holy Spirit is with us. May we therefore do all these things to further the Kingdom and for Your glory alone. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Les to bring us today's reading from second Samuel.
