## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 20th December 2020 

__Psalms 140:12-13__ _I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted And justice for the poor. Surely the righteous will give thanks to Your Name; The upright will dwell in Your Presence._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You  that we can come into Your Presence in this place in greater numbers than before. In the beginning, You created all, it was very good and You made man the pinnacle of Your Creation, to worship You and remain in Your Presence. Yet because of Adam's sin, we live in an imperfect world, which needs a Perfect Saviour.

Each year at this season, we remember that You did not leave this world stranded and under the control of the devil. We thank You that You sent Jesus to do what was impossible for us. We thank You that He came quietly, as a helpless member of the human race, growing as we do, facing all the temptations we do, and yet remaining without sin and living the Perfect Life of obedience to Your Will.

We celebrate the Christmas season with joy, but we realise that His destiny was the Easter Cross, and the Empty Tomb, because He came to die in our place. 

In place of our sinful nature, You have given us the righteous life of Jesus, so that now we are able to give thanks to Your Name. Now, we can be called upright and dwell in Your Presence

### The Wider World ... ### 
We thank You that restricitons in Victoria are easing as the number of reported Covid cases remains low. We continue to pray for our leaders and their medical advisers. We look forward to further easing of restrictions in future, and continue to pray for progress with research into various available treatments.

### ... and the wider Church ###
In the wider church, we pray for persecuted believers, whose Christmas may be anything but joyful. We particularly pray for believers in Nigeria where attacks are relentless. As a Commonwealth country, we pray for other Commonwealth leaders to find ways to support official Nigerian efforts to deal with the militants. We remember also refugee believers who have fled from Iran now barely surviving in Turkey, Bosnia and Serbia.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we give thanks for Margaret Sanders progress but we pray for the medical staff as they seek to understand the cause of her condition and plan for the best treatment. We pray also for those who can't be with us as yet - Flora, Nolene, Theodore and Margaret Loo.

We also continue to support Aash and Divia and family here, and Aash's sister and mother in India as they face Christmas without Aash's Dad. We thank You for his life and ministry and rest in the knowledge that he is now at peace in Your presence.

We uphold Barry, Mook and all the team preparing our services. We also give thanks for the Elders, the Board managers and everyone rostered on to the cleaning tasks after the service.

We strive to endure all things, including the restrictions, for the sake of the Kingdom and for the glory of the King of Kings, Amen.
