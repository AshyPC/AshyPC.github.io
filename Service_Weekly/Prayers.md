## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 127:1__ _Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labour in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You are the Only God, the Maker of Heaven and Earth. You are the Creator, the source of Life and the Sustainer of all that You have made. We thank You that You are "from everlasting to everlasting" and You are bringing together people from all over this world to honour and worship the Son Whom You have installed as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. 

We thank You for Your mercy, in turning us from Your enemies into adopted members of Your heavenly household, so that we share in the inheritance which belongs to Jesus, in the indestructible life which is His and in the incredible priveleges of sonship, which You bestowed upon us when You graciously saved us from Your righteous judgement, through the Cross and the Resurrection.

### The World & The Church
** Queen's Birthday **
As we come tomorrow to a public holiday for the Queen's Birthday, we give thanks for Her Majesty who bears the title of Defender of the Faith. We thank You that she submits to the heavenly authority of the Lord Jesus, and is the source of earthly sovereignty for our nation. May we respect the rightful authority of our governments at all levels, even whilst we hold our representatives to account for the discharge of their duties as servants of the Crown and of our national interests. We pray for wisdom in the decisions they make, for discernment of right and wrong as You declare, and for righteousness in all their dealings.  

We thank You for the church which You have established and built, to carry out Your will in this world. We see it so often weakened by error and apostacy, as we learn more about the Reformation and compare those times with the days in which we live. We pray for Your church to be strengthened, for the Scriptures to be understood as the sole source of Your revelation, the Truth of both Your justice and Your mercy, the basis of Your message of reconciliation. 

May we work alongside You as You build and as You watch over Your Church. We pray that as members of the Body of Christ we would be able to support one another in sharing the Good News with a world which seems to relish the telling of bad news. 

### Ashburton
We praise You for your steadfast love and great mercy towards us here in Ashburton, Lord. We ask You to show us the state of our work for the Kingdom and the way we live. We want to honour You in all things and we thank You that You are building **this house** and watching over **our city.** We pray for righteousness to prevail so that we are not distracted from the task of finding those whom You have marked for salvation, so that they may not only hear the Good News but also respond and thus walk in newness of life. And all these things we pray in Jesus precious Name, Amen.

And now I will hand over to Barry for today's reading from second Samuel chapter 6.
