## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 10th December 2017
__Psalms 130:7__ _O Israel, hope in the Lord ; For with the Lord there is lovingkindness, And with Him is abundant redemption._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we gather today as we have always done, because we come to acknowledge You our Sovereign Lord. We thank You for Jesus Who is co-Creator, our Redeemer and our coming King. We thank You that there is only one Name under heaven by which we can be saved.

### The World and the Church
However, we are sad, mayube even angry at the displays seen in our Federal Parliament this week, as our representatives revelled in their rejection of Your ordinance for marriage. We are sad that they believe the Bill can redefine a circle into a square, and that somehow the change will solve important problems in Australian society.

We live in a State with the worst abortion law in the nation, the worst "protection" for the dying, and now the change to the legal definition of marriage, and we have to admit that we are ripe for Your judgement. Yet we hold to Your Word and put our hope in You. We trust in Your unfailing love and abundant redemption. 

We continue to pray for a door of opportunity, so that we may share the Good News of Your great grace. 

We pray for Your Church to be strong, and that various denominations would make a firm stand on the solid foundation of Your Word. 

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We pray for the Carols Service to be well attended, and for the many visitors to understand the true meaning of the popular songs of this season. May they come to know that this baby Jesus is not only the Lamb of God, but also the coming King of kings. 

We also pray for those in our midst who are in need of Your particular love and care. We especially pray for Ruth Morrow and her family, as a=well as remembering Muriel, Bruce, and Jim & Diane,and Ken.

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will ask Gaye McKenzie to bring our second reading, from Romans.
