## Prayer of Thanksgiving for Christmas Day

## 25th December 2023

__Isaiah 9:2__ 
_The people walking in darkness have seen a great light;_
_on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned._

Father God, we thank You that today we gather to commemorate the First Coming of the Great Light – the One Who is the Light of the World.

At the very time that sin spoiled Your very good Creation, You promised Adam and Eve that One would come to overcome the sin and restore righteousness. We thank You that although He came as a baby, He did not remain so, but grew to fulfill Your purpose so that we might be saved. 

We thank You that Christmas does not stand alone but is connected to Easter, when Jesus went to the Cross to defeat sin and the devil, to secure our pardon and to make us fit for heaven.

We thank You that He rose from the dead, and has returned to heaven as the forerunner, the Firstborn from the dead, to prepare a place for all who believe. 

Some today hold on to a vague hope of a brighter future without any assurance, and others have given up all hope. But we thank You that Your Word declares boldly the Eternal Hope of salvation, freely available to all who will listen. 

We thank You for the assurance of His return, that Second Coming which will bring in the New Heavens and New Earth, where there will be no need for the light of the sun, moon or stars, but Your Very Presence as Father, Son and Holy Spirit will be the True Light that we have searched for all along.

We thank You that Jesus was

Born a king on Bethelem’s plain
but that He is King Forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

Hallelujah!
