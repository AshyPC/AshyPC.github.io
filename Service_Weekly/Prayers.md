## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 21st June 2020 

__Psalms 77:1__ _I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are sovereign and nothing is beyond Your control. We thank You that You are the God Who hears us, the One Who has rescued us from the depths of our sin.
We thank You that we can cry out to You at this time when we have not been able to gather in worship and, from tomorrow, we face further restrictions in our own homes. but have had to "meet" with the help of modern technology. We thank You that we are still able to sing Your praises and hear Your Word read and preached. 

We confess that there is a lot of fear within this State as the number of reported Covid cases jumped recently. We pray for our leaders and their medical advisers, and that the restrictions may soon be eased. We thank You that so few lives have been lost to the virus in Victoria and Australia generally.

### The Wider World ### 
We pray again today for continued efforts to reduce the impact of the virus in other places. We also pray for great wisdom in leadership as countries grapple with the upsurge in violent protests. This is not a time for compounding the effects of a medical emergency with street riots and lawlessness.

We continue to pray that our governments may reverse their emergency powers steadily and allow life to return to normal. We give thanks for the lifting of some restrictions already, and look forward to easier times ahead, even if that is not to happen immediately.

### and the wider Church ###
We pray that Your people everywhere may be bold and yet wise as our freedom of movement is restored so that we express our trust in You in everything we do.

Even while our focus is on one thing, we know that Your church marches on, and Your work in the world does not slacken. We thank You for the Commission of Assembly meeting in this past week and for the weighty decisions made in a spirit of unity. May all the decisions be blessed as they seek to further the continuation of gospel ministry by the PCV.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for wisdom for the Session, the Board and other leaders as they plan ahead for the restoration of our various ministries, even while restrictions continue for the time being.

We give thanks for answered prayer as Rachel Oakes has found accommodation and a church in Sydney and has commenced her full-time work. We continue to pray for her as she builds new Godly relationships with both church members and work colleagues.
We pray also for Suzanne's chaplaincy work at the Royal Children's Hospital, made more difficult by the current restrictions.

We remember with sadness Murial French, who was received into glory recently. We give thanks that she is at peace now and pray for her family and friends in the present circumstances.

We continue to uphold Barry, Mook, the musicians and others who take part in our video services so that we are still able to take part in worship remotely, and hear Your Word read and preached. We ask for Your encouragement in our own times of reading Your Word and praying for each other so that when we are able to meet again our fellowship may be enriched and stronger despite this time of separation.

Whilst we continue in a restricted way to "meet together" online, we pray that You would be drawing us closer to Yourself daily. May we receive the Word planted in our hearts, and may our desires turn heaven-wards more and more.

In everything we do, may we strive to make known the Great and Precious Name of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, for Whose glory we pray all these things, Amen.
