## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 2nd January 2022

__Psalm 27:1__ 
_The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we mark the passing of time on our calendars and we acknowledge You as the Lord of Time and eternity. We honour the Lord Jesus as we count up the years of His never-ending reign over us.

We thank You that You are our light and our salvation, the stronghold of our lives. We come before You today, the God Who answers prayer, Who is greater than all and Who delivers us from all our fears.

We thank You that You have provided us with the means of grace and today we can commence a new year with a communion service. We have just concluded celebrations remembering when Jesus first came as a babe, and today we will remember His victory in the Cross and Resurrection.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We look about this wide world that so clearly needs to recognise Your Supreme Authority and we pray for Your continued mercy. We recall the earthquakes, the tragedies, and the ongoing troubles of Your people everywhere. We pray for protection as the Body of Christ suffers persecution in many places and courage and strength for Your people. We lift up before You believers in India, Pakistan and Nigeria in particular. May false accusations be exposed quickly and come to nothing as they are brought into the light of day.

We cannot escape the ever-present news of the spread of the latest variant of Covid-19. We give thanks for Your mercy as we see that it causes less serious illness although it spreads more quickly. May we be ready to acknowledge Your mercy in this latest development and Your sovereignty over the entire time this pandemic has been been spreading around the world.

We pray also for clarity as our various governments introduce changes to the Covid restrictions, and we seek to be personally responsible for our own protection, as the Prime Miinister recently called for with a new approach to the situation we face.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for Mook and Talia, Jethro and Amy as they take a holiday break. Bless and refresh them, guide them and keep them safe, we pray. As restrictions are relaxed we can think about holidays once again. For all who are able to take a break we pray Your protection and for their safety in travel. We pray for those who are unwell also; for Shiun as he progresses in recovery and for Diane’s health while her treatment continues.

We pray also for Nolene Andersen, giving thanks that she has attained her centenary but we pray for her health as she becomes more frail. Please uphold her family as they minister to her and bless the staff of the aged care home as they provide her with close daily care.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we face the kind of difficulties which Peter’s readers also faced in their time. As we listen we pray for wisdom and discernment, that we may live according to Your Word, growing stronger in our faith and bringing honour to the Name of Jesus, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
