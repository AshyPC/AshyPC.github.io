## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 2nd September 2018

__Psalm 86:11__ 
_Teach me Your way, Lord, that I may rely on Your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your Name._

David prayed in these terms regularly. Let us follow his example as we pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are Lord of times and seasons, and we come into Your Presence as winter leaves us and Spring commences. As we see fresh life come into the natural creation, we remember that You did not leave us dead in sin but You gave us new Life by raising up Jesus, Your own Son, from the dead. 

We thank You Jesus, for coming into our world in obedience to the Father to bring salvation to us, a salvation we could not achieve for ourselves, and today we celebrate the Supper in memory of that great deliverance - greater even than the Exodus was for the nation of Israel.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life to bring the New Life of Jesus to us so that we are no longer dead in our sins. We thank You for Your continuing Presence with Your people, to guide us, teach us and sanctify us daily. We thank You that You are faithful in keeping us, and we pray that we may have an undivided heart so that we do not stray from Your way. Enable Your church to preserve the unity You have worked within us, to show others how Your Kingdom works in restored relationships.

We are distressed to see new reports of sin within churches, and long for the day when we might see a Bride spotless and ready for the return of her King. We pray that we may know and obey Your Word, so that we may revere Your Name and see Your purposes established, both in this world and the next.

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world which continues to turn its back on You. We especially pray for wise and responsible national government as we see a new Federal ministry taking office. We face a State election and pray for an upright election campaign period and wise policies for the good of all Victorians. And when it comes time to cast our votes, may we recognise the privilege of being able to vote, which not even Paul the apostle enjoyed and apply Godly wisdom to the simple task of marking a ballot paper.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us. We thank You and pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries - Seniors centre, Youth and Young Adults, ESL, Sunday School, missionary support, and the Christianity Explored course concluding today. As we come to our annual meeting and special meeting to follow, we thank You for the endorsement of Presbytery and its oversight of our progress. May all of the necessary steps proceed smoothly, so that we may move into the next stage of Your work within us and around about us. And may those who do not yet know You see in us the light of life so that they too may become members of the Body of Christ.

In all these things, we rejoice as we seek to remain faithful to Your calling and the leading of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
