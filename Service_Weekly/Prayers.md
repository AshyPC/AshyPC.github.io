## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 31st January 2021

__Psalm 24:7-8__ _Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.  Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that, although we are separated today, we can come into Your Presence remotely. Knowing that we live in an imperfect, sin-affected world, which needs a Perfect Saviour, We thank You that You are still with us wherever we are. Being together is better than being apart but we pray for our service today to still be a means of lifting up the Name of Jesus.

### The Wider World ... ### 
We thank You that Jesus is the King of Glory Whom the whole world seeks. We know that too many seek wrongly, thinking that the so-called "answer to life" can be found in this world, when in reality, the King of Glory is enthroned in the heavens, and will return again at the time You have appointed for the end of this earthly history.

We thank You that the Covid-19 virus has receded even further. We continue to pray for our governments to remove the emergency measures, and to restore the freedoms we knew from times past.

Whilst we have been focused on local happenings, we have not heard much about events elsewhere. We pray for communities in Sulawesi, Indonesia, which suffered from a large earthquake two weeks ago. We recognise the immense power of such natural forces and remember that You are in control, even if we can only see chaos and destruction. We pray for the continuing rescue efforts, for the distribution of aid and for the restoration of law and order in the earthquake zone.

### ... and the wider Church ###
In the midst of this we also pray for believers in that zone, where many are homeless and where churches have also collapsed. We pray also for Barnabas Fund workers who are in the forefront of aid efforts there.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for health needs within our number. We thank You for Mook recovering and pray that You strengthen him for the preaching of Your Word today. We also pray for Talia, Jethro and Amy still recovering from the heavy colds they have suffered in this past week. We also pray for Margaret Sanders, now taking stronger medication for trigeminal neuralgia. We pray again for Barry and Suzanne on their break - they give so much of themselves in the calling You have placed on their lives, so we pray that You would refill them and refresh them by Your Spirit.

Despite this being an online service today, we pray that we can strengthen our fellowship, rebuild our unity and work to build the Kingdom of God as You enable us by Your Spirit.

We strive in the strength You give us, for the sake of the Kingdom, to see the glory of the King of Kings made manifest in this world, Amen.
