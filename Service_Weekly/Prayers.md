## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 24th December 2017

__Deuteronomy 4:31__ _For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which He confirmed to them by oath._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that we are in Your hands every single day. With Moses we remember that You are merciful, faithful and You fulfill Your covenant promises. You took twelve enslaved tribes and turned them into a powerful nation. They were fickle and faithless, but You remained faithful to Your promise to Abraham. Despite all, You showed Yourself merciful, and finally You sent Jesus to deal with the sin problem completely. 

We thank You for Jesus, Who came as a babe, and we thank You for Your patience with us as He grew to full stature, experiencing all that we go through, except sin itself.

He came to seek and save the lost, to serve and not to be served, to redeem us through the Cross, and do the impossible, for we could not save ourselves.

We thank You Holy Spirit for Your constant Presence with us. When Jesus returned to heaven, You came so that we would not be alone, abandoned in a world still in the hold of the enemy. 

### The World & The Church
As we enjoy the festive season, and endure the commercial aspects of Christmas, we pray that this nation and this world would see that there is solid truth underneath the surface, and that more and more people would turn back to You as they realize what will truly satisfy the longing of their souls.

We pray for this world to know Your constant Presence, Your care and love for all Your creation. We pray that Your character of love, grace and mercy would be seen in us so that others can come to know You too.

You have placed us within Your Church so that others may see that we are no longer serving ourselves, but that we serve one another instead. We pray that everything we do will demonstrate that we live by the rules of a greater kingdom because our true allegiance is to the King of Kings. His first coming as a babe in a manger was heralded by angels to some shepherds, but His second coming will be visible to all.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the Carols service and for the Carols time at Grand Cedar. We thank You for those who responded and sang along, recalling the words. May they be encouraged and comforted by our witness to Your Presence. 

We also want to remember Ruth Morrow and thank You that she is with You in glory. We pray for her family and friends as they grieve her passing.  

As we pray Lord, we remember that You are good - all the time, and that every good gift comes from Your gracious hand, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles for today's second reading, from Romans 7:7-25.
