## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 7th May 2023

As the world has just witnessed the solemn pageantry of the coronation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom, we read this solemn warning from Psalm 2.

__Psalms 2:10-11__ 
_Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
Serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we give You thanks today for Your great mercies to us. We have witnessed a singular event  - for some, the only one of this scale and ceremony in our lives – the transfer of earthly authority in the United Kingdom from the late Queen Elizabeth to the incoming King Charles. Within this Christian ceremony witnessed by millions are signs and symbols pointing to the Greater King of Kings, our Lord Jesus, Who now sits at Your right hand, ruling over all things, seen and unseen.

But before he took the Eternal Throne, Jesus laid aside His heavenly glory to humble Himself and take our lowly place, receiving the due punishment for our sin. We acknowledge today that, as descendents of Adam, we are powerless to do anything to save ourselves, and are in desperate need of such a gracious Saviour.

And we thank You that, based entirely and only on His finished work on the Cross, You have adopted us into the heavenly family, calling us Your sons and daughters, and clothing us in His perfect righteousness.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for King Charles, as he commits to his oaths of office, to uphold justice, protect the weak and defend the Christian faith. He was presented with the sword of government authority to uphold what is right and to punish evil, as expressed in the ceremony: a symbol of justice rather than judgement, of mercy instead of might, and trusting in the Word of God which is the sword of the Spirit.

As we pray “God Save the King!” we ask also that we would be blessed with righteous government from the Governor-General and Federal Parliament, to the State Parliament and to our local councils as they exercise delegated authority under the Crown.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here, and acknowledge that the Kingdom of God takes precedence over the kingdoms of man. We continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program, and pray for the Re-Vision workshop coming up in two weeks. We pray for wisdom for the Session, the Board and others attending, as we develop ways of putting our God-given vision into concrete proposals and actions.We continue to recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We therefore seek to do as He did when on this earth, and be guided by the Holy Spirit in everything we do.

We give thanks for Your Word, the sword of the Spirit. As Barry comes to expound that Word to us today, we thank You for his preparation, and pray that we will become morediligent doers, following the example of our Servant King, Jesus, Who is also our Lord and Saviour, Amen.



Our Father, Who is in heaven,
hallowed be Your name;
Your kingdom come;
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

For Yours is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
