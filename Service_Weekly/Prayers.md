## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 27th May 2018

__Psalm 71:14-15__ 
_But as for me, I will hope continually, And will praise You yet more and more. My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness And of Your salvation all day long_


Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the God of hope, Who did not leave Adam and Eve in a hopeless position of sin but promised to deal fully and completely with sin and rebellion in mankind. 

We thank You that Jesus, the Eternal Son, came into our world to bring salvation to us, a salvation not brought about by our labour, but granted by You as a gift, according to Your sovereign choice and purpose, based upon His finished work on the Cross.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit to be with us Your people, to guide us, teach us and santify us daily. We thank You that it is by His enabling, rather than our own efforts, that we work in the Kingdom to obey Your Word and see Your purposes established in this world and the next.   

### The World & The Church
It is sad to hear that in Ireland the voters have chosen by majority to repeal a constitutional protection for unborn children, so that more babies (and mothers) are now at risk than ever before.

We pray for our world which continues to vote against choosing life and yet we thank You that in other places people are choosing life instead. We see a world in which men seek wisdom in the wrong places, trusting in numbers and majority votes instead of turning to the only One Who is the true wisdom from above.

We pray for the work of the church in extending the Kingdom. We do not lose heart but want to persevere in the hope born of the work of Your Holy Spirit within us. We want to praise You more and more, and declare Your righteousness and Your salvation daily. We want to see more people come to know You, and to know the sure hope of eternal life and the blessed assurance of sins forgiven. 

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us as part of Your great work to win souls. Help us to demonstrate the hope that we have as members of the Kingdom of Heaven, knowing we are pilgrims on a journey, with an eternal perspective, looking for the city with foundations.

We pray for those who are not well, knowing that we are all subject to the weaknesses of winter chills, colds and 'flu. Sustain us we pray so that we may continue to serve. We especially remember Hazel McGrath, and we continue to pray for Tim as he recovers from his surgery.

In all these things we seek to remain faithful to Your calling and the leading of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will hand back to Barry.
