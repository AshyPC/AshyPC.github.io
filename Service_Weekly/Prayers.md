## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 28th April 2024

__John 15:13__ 
    _Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends_

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we bow before You today, taking to heart the words of David in Psalm 138 that You are high and Greatly praised, yet You do not forsake the lowly. We thank You that You sent Jesus to make us his friends, even though we had turned away from You and become Your enemies.

We thank You for Jesus dying for us while we were still sinners, so that we would know Your love poured out on us, by looking to Him.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
Lord, we look at our broken world and confess the sinfulness of mankind refusing to turn back to You. We confess that our broken relationship with You leads to other broken relationships between peoples and nations, often expressed in hatred and war.

This week we remembered the wartime sacrifices made by so many in the past to defend our nation and the freedoms we enjoy on this island continent. As we remember, we pray for peace instead of war, even though we realise that true and lasting peace will only come when Jesus the Prince of Peace returns visibly as King of kings and Lord of lords.

We pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the safety of the nation of Israel as it defends itself in the midst of irrational hostility which has broken out around the world. We pray for peace in the Ukraine and Eastern Europe, for peace in places of persecution, for peace in place of terrorism, which overshadows many parts of the world.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities, to govern wisely and well, to work for unity rather than division, for the good progress of this wide brown land we call home.

We pray for our remote and indigenous communities, and we yearn for true reconciliation through the work of the Gospel, and a move of the Holy Spirit. We thank You for those who are already saved according to Your Word, sharing the Good News, and holding to the true hope as they look for Jesus return, just as we do here. We are saddened by the loss of trust and harmony within communities, local and remote, and pray that it might be rebuilt as more people place their trust in You, the Great Healer.

__Ashburton (post-Anzac Day)__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to reach our local community here. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued witness to those around us, where we live, study, and work. In the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
