## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 12th March 2023

__Deuteronomy 32:3‭-‬4 (NASB)__ 
_For I will proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe greatness to our God “The Rock!” His work is perfect, for all his ways are just. A God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is he._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, You have taken us out of darkness and brought us into Your marvellous light, not because of anything we have done but because You are righteous and upright. We thank You that Your salvation is all because of Your grace in sending Jesus to take our place. We deserved judgement but You have shown us unmerited mercy. You are upright and truly just, so that sin received its due penalty. Yet we are not lost for now You have adopted us into the heavenly family, calling us Your sons and daughters and granting us even the faith to believe the Good News of the Gospel.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world and give You thanks for the places where the Gospel is known and proclaimed. We thank You for missionaries such as the Mihalyis and Sam & Dhruti Christian who have gone to distant places, but also for those who serve closer to home.

Lord, you have numbered our days. Teach us how to number our days. Show us how to redeem the time you have allotted so that it truly counts for eternity. We seek your wisdom to set our priorities towards eternal things and away from the things of this world.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here in Ashburton, and we continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program. Please grant great wisdom and insight to Rod Morris as he walks beside us and mentors us through this process.

We continue to seek You for the fulfillment ofYour purposes here in the community around us. We pray that we increasingly align ourselves with Your work here, that we may proclaim in word and deed Your love and mercy, Your faithfulness and justice and Your desire to see people come to faith within this community.

Among our own number we pray for restoration of health for Diane, Shiun and for Russell and Jocelyn. We also uphold Steph and Callum, and thank You for Levi’s progress. We continue to pray for his growth so that he can be released from hospital soon.

We give thanks for Your Word which is freely available to us, which we can read for ourselves as well as hearing it proclaimed publicly. We pray for Grant Lawry as he preaches today: giving thanks for his preparation under Your guidance, and we pray that we too will know that heavenly guidance. May we live out the truth of Your powerful response to faithful prayer, so that we bring honour to the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Who is also our Great High Priest before Your Throne, Amen.


Our Father, Who is in heaven,
hallowed be Your name;
Your kingdom come;
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

For Yours is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
