## Prayers for our church and the world

__Deuteronomy 4:31__ _For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which He confirmed to them by oath._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that we are in Your hands every single day. With Moses we remember that You are merciful, faithful and You fulfill Your covenant promises. You took twelve enslaved tribes and turned them into a powerful nation. They were fickle and faithless, but You remained faithful to Your promise to Abraham. Despite all, You showed Yourself merciful, and finally You sent Jesus to deal with the sin problem completely. 

We thank You for Jesus, Who came to seek and save the lost. He came to serve and not to be served, to redeem us through the Cross, and do the impossible, for we could not save ourselves.

We thank You Holy Spirit for Your constant Presence with us. When Jesus returned to heaven, You came so that we would not be alone, abandoned in a world still in the hold of the enemy. 

### The World & The Church
We pray for this world to know Your constant Presence, Your care and love for all Your creation. We pray that Your character of love, grace and mercy would be seen in us so that others can come to know You too.

You have placed us within Your Church so that others may see that we are no longer serving ourselves, but that we serve one another instead. We pray that today's activities may demonstrate that we live by the rules of a greater kingdom because our true allegiance is to the King of Kings.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the completion of preparations for the Family Fun Afternoon, and for the leaflets distributed during this week. May they attract our near local neighbours so that we can bless them this afternoon. 

Also, we pray again for our work with ESL students, and especially for Suzanne who is still seeking work to fulfill her visa requirements. 

We pray for those amongt us in need of Your healing hand. Thank You for Les Oliver's progress during his recovery. We also pray for Jim Gleeson and Muriel French with their heart troubles. We thank You for the close family care they receive.

As we pray Lord, we remember that You are good - all the time, and that every good gift comes from Your gracious hand, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles as Gaye McKenzie brings us today's second reading, which will be from Matthew chapter 25.
