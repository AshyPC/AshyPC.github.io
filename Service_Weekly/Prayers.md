## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 24th September 2017

__Isaiah 33:22__ _For the Lord is our judge, The Lord is our lawgiver, The Lord is our king; He will save us._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that You welcome us into Your Presence because You have set Your love upon us. Help us to remember that You are also, as Isaiah describes, our Judge, Lawgiver and King, so that we come into Your Presence with awe and reverence. 
Teach us what holy fear is, so that we may not be casual in our spiritual walk but sober and gracious as we acknowledge You - our Maker, Redeemer and Keeper of our souls.

We thank You for Jesus, God the Son, Second Person of the Trinity, the One Who died in our place, and Who rose on the third day to give us New Life. We thank You, Holy Spirit that You are with us daily, teaching us, changing us into the likeness of Jesus, guiding us so that we are daily more accurate in showing others how we live as people of the Risen King, serving and loving one another in a new Kingdom.

### Thanks for the Word
We thank You for Your Word which reveals to us all we need in this life for faith and Godliness. We thank You for the clear teaching which guides us in our relationships one with another. We thank You for the Holy Spirit Who reveals to us the Truth of what it says, and empowers us to obey.

### The World and the Church
We thank You for the Church founded on the rock of revelation that Jesus is the Messisah Who was to come, and moreso that He is God Himself Who came down to earth to do what was impossible for us. We thank You that Your church is where we learn how to live to bless others and not to seek our own way, how to relate to each other, care for each other, and to prefer others ahead of meeting our own needs.

We pray that how we live will be evident to a watching world which has had enough of bad church, and longs for what only the Kingdom of Heaven can give. May we portray to the world only what is good, born out of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, as He brings us together in unity of purpose. 

We also pray for ourselves as we submit to Your Word, and we pray for Barry in his preaching. Grant us the Godly wisdom we need to apply Your Word to our lives, so that it actually makes a difference to how we live each day.

### Ashburton
As we enter the school holiday period, we thank You for those parts of our program which pause for the break. Grant rest to the Sunday School teachers, the ESL teachers and helpers, the youth leaders. We pray for those activities which continue - bless and strengthen eveyone working with the Seniors ministry, community groups and music team. We pray that each of our lives will continue to reflect the love You have shown us, so that we make the good news of Jesus our Saviour attractive to those who seek to know You, so  that by whatever means You enable us to use, we may bring others to the foot of the Cross. 

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will hand back to Barry before we stand to sing.
