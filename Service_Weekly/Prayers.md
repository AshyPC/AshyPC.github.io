## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 23rd January 2023
__When Joseph revealed who he was to his brothers, he said:__
__Jeremiah 9:24__ 
_...do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father we come into Your Presence today to give You honour and praise. We thank You that You see the end from the beginning, whereas we are limited to this world where we see time unfold one day at a time. As Joseph declared, You are the Only God, the One Who saves lives. Joseph was a forerunner of the True Saviour, one who was sent ahead of his brothers so that a people could be saved four hundred years later.

We honour You, Who sent our Lord Jesus to this earth to be our Saviour. He is not ashamed to call us His brothers and sisters. We thank You that He has fulfilled the Law perfectly, and has given us His complete righteousness in place of our sin. We walk free because He has taken the penalty, removed our guilt and cancelled the power of sin.

We thank You that we are now free to resist temptation and escape the power of sin by doing the works of righteousness You have prepared for us in advance.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where many turn their backs upon Jesus, many try to defy You and dethrone You, and others remain in darkness, never knowing that You are the only God, the One Who truly loves them with the full knowledge of how utterly sinful they are, and that salvation through Jesus alone is possible.

We pray for Your Church, greatly distressed in so many places around the world where persecution robs believers of peace and safety. We pray also for the work of PresAID which aims to help peoples to depend on God rather than becoming dependent on foreign countries supplying aid, seemingly forever.

We pray for the Church in our country where it has been sidelined and ignored because people do not seek the Truth. Yet we know Your work continues Lord. We pray for Matt and Kate Vinicombe and family as they deal with the serious aftereffects of the road accident. We thank You for the excellent medical care Kate is receiving in the Austin Spinal Unit. We pray also for our Assembly Clerk John Wilson and his wife Paula as they grieve the loss of their daughter Emily, who passed into Godâ€™s presence after a long and difficult illness.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here in Ashburton, and pray for the Elders and Board of Management as they lead us by serving. We continue to pray for the Revitalization program. Help us to take an active part in the process, so that we can be a more effective channel for Your grace and mercy to this community. We pray also for restoration of the health of Margaret, Diane, Shiun, and Russell. We also uphold Steph and Callum, as Steph is required to rest for the remainder of her pregnancy. We also pray for refreshing for Barry and Suzanne as they take a break for two weeks.

We pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word today. May he expound it clearly so that we grow both in mind and spirit, in hearing and doing all that You call us to do. We pray for ourselves too, that we be active listeners and doers of Your Word so that we bring glory to the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
