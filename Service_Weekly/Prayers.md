## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 23rd April 2023

__John 15:13__ 
_Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we come to You today, giving thanks for Your great mercies to us. You sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sin, to bear Your righteous wrath against our rejection of Your sovereign grace towards us.

He demonstrated His unfathomable love by going to the Cross and then You demonstrated Your power in raising Him on the Third Day. And now the Holy Spirit has come to enable us to respond from changed hearts as we cry out “Abba, Father!”

When we stray we thank You that we are not cut off forever but He draws us back to the Cross. When we sin we are reminded that we have an advocate before Your throne of grace – Jesus Christ the Righteous One. And we thank You for having adopted us into the heavenly family, calling us Your sons and daughters solely based on the perfect righteousness of Christ our Saviour.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
This week there will be a focus on remembering those who served and died to defend our nation, our heritage and our freedoms. We pray for a greater understanding of the true source of our freedoms in serving You within the Kingdom of heaven, as we work within the church on earth. For, whom the Son sets free is free indeed.

We pray for our military chaplains working with the armed forces, ministering to people who are being trained daily for a task they hope never to have to carry out. Yet, they are ready and willing, so that we may rest easy and enjoy the blessings preserved for us by their diligence.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here, and we continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program. We pray for wisdom for the Session, the Board and in fact all of us, as we plan and work, but continue to recognise that it is Your church that Jesus is building. We therefore seek to do as He did when on this earth, and be guided by the Holy Spirit in everything we do.

We give thanks for Your Word which is freely available to us, which we can read for ourselves as well as hearing it proclaimed publicly. May we never take it for granted but read it diligently and often. As Barry comes to expound Your Word to us today, we thank You for his preparation, and pray that we will receive it and live it out, so that we bring honour to the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.



Our Father, Who is in heaven,
hallowed be Your name;
Your kingdom come;
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

For Yours is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
