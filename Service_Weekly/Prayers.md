## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 11th Aug 2019 College Thanksgiving Sunday
__Jeremiah 17:7-8__ _Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord And whose trust is the Lord. For he will be like a tree planted by the water, that extends its roots by a stream and will not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought nor cease to yield fruit._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come before You today, as those who know our lost condition. We are inheritors of Adam's fallen nature. Therefore we are encouraged by Jeremiah's words as those who have put their trust only in Your great mercy and grace. 

### The World and the Church
We thank You for the Theological College and its training work, preparing ministers and missionaries so that they may be truly effective in their calling to serve You. We pray for Peter Hastie, the College Principal, for the academic and administrative staff as they work together to achieve the goals of the College. We pray for the TEC as the Committee overseeing the College on behalf of the PCV, and we pray for similar Colleges in other States. We ask that the Holy Spirit would guard them and the teaching they deliver to the students so that all those who graduate may be fully equipped, ready preach Your Word faithfully and vigorously. We pray for Your Church to be strong in the face of opposition and pressure to compromise with the Word. 

We pray especially for the many churches which have been invaded by worldly attitudes, ideas and practices. We pray that they may be turned around by means of Godly, Biblical preaching and teaching. We all long for the church to again be known as the Pillar of Truth in this community and this nation, that it fulfill Jeremiah's image of a strong tree, nourished by Your Holy Spirit, able to withstand heat and drought and continue to bear the fruit of righteousness. 

### Ashburton
We thank You, Lord that here we enjoy the blessings of faithful, powerful, Godly preaching. We continue to pray for Your protection and guidance for Barry and Mook, and we thank You for Matt bringing Your Word to us today. May he be led by Your Spirit, to speak firmly and clearly, may we be attentive, ready to take in Your Word and then equally ready to obey that Word of Truth which reveals the Kingdom of the One and Only Saviour, our Redeemer, In Whose Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now Rachel will bring our second reading for today.
