## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 2nd December 2018

Psalm 136:1__ 
_Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good. His love endures for ever._


### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we do thank You that You are both Good and Merciful, and also Holy, True and Just. We know from Your Word that Sin attracts the just penalty of death. And we know that we were under that sentence because we followed the first Adam's sin.  

We thank You that Jesus came to rescue us by accepting on our behalf the death which we deserved. The Second Adam is the only One Who has fully and perfectly obeyed Your Word. You have graciously provided that Your Goodness and Mercy is to triumph over Judgement in a way that preserves Justice and demonstrates Your Holiness.

His perfect sacrifice and His victorious resurrection has enabled us to receive Your Mercy, and allow us today to come into Your Presence, to remember what He has done and to celebrate this foretaste of the Marriage Feast of the Lamb which is still to come.

We thank You Father that the Holy Spirit is with us in this service and in remains our Comforter and Guide daily to change us to be more and more like Jesus. 

### The World 
We thank You Holy Spirit for the hope You plant in our hearts and the love You give us for others. Without these we would despair at every action of a cruel world under the hand of a defeated enemy who still seeks to turn men and women away from You.

Today we pray against a proposed new law to be debated this week, which would make it harder for our Christian schools to teach according to the Biblical standards we uphold. We pray that this Bill would be defeated completely and that its proposers be restrained from any further attacks upon Your people and Your Church. 

### The Church
We thank You again that the Church is separate from politics but we are realists, aware that we live in a fallen world. As in the days of Nehemiah, we pray for strength for those who defend Your church from external attacks, and we pray for strength for those who continue to build up the church from within. We thank You for the training colleges, the faithful teachers of men who take Your Word into pulpits around this nation. We pray that Your Church in Australia would rise up to meet this challenge in the strength of the Holy Spirit, and with the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

### Ashburton
We pray for Barry as he preaches, for the Sunday School team as they guide the young ones, for the study groups and young people as they learn to apply Your eternal Word to the events of our day.

We pray for boldness in speaking of Your love, and for strength to do what is right at all times, regardless of what our governments do against the Church. May all that we do bring honour to the Name of Jesus, for it is in His Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Theodore will bring us our next reading today from the Gospel of Luke.
