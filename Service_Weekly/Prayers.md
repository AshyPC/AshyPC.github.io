## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 7th April 2019

Ruth 1:16__ _Ruth said, "Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God."_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your Presence with us today, because of Jesus' Life, Death and Resurrection. We thank You that today we recognise our unity at the Lord's Table. We pray that it would be the means for strengthening the bonds of fellowship, and that we would remain faithful to Your calling in this congregation, especially seeing the loyalty and faithfulness of Ruth towards Naomi and the God of Israel. 

### The World 
In this world, Lord, we see a lot of division and separation. Whether it is sport, politics, religion or nationality, there are many who seek to foster differences and divisions, setting one against another for personal advantage. Sometimes it leads to the kind of terrible violence we saw in New Zealand, at other times it is mere sporting rivalry. We pray for a realisation that there is a new and living way through Jesus, and we thank You that there is still Good News being spread around this world, against the bad news which is too often shown on our TVs and in our newspapers.

### The Church
We pray for Your Church to demonstrate that differences do not need to become separation or division. We pray also that the Church can be a living example showing that sameness is not unity but that unity in the faith fosters loyal fellowship. We thank You for the example of Ruth who left an old life behind to adopt a new life within the Covenant people of Israel.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the success of the Family Fun Day yesterday. Thank You for the excitement of the children and for the many conversations which we had with our visitors. We pray for those who came, whether from the surrounding area or from far away: may You continue to move in their lives via the Holy Spirit, and may they come to a true understanding of the Cross, that there is True Life in only One - Jesus Christ - and that they may also share in that true life in the same way as we who are already a part of the Body. We thank You also for the hard work of all the helpers, for Mook in his organising and leadership, and we appreciate the extra hour of rest overnight.

We pray for all those involved in ministry here - for Barry and Mook as they prepare and preach Your Word, the music group and tech team, the Sunday School teachers and helpers, the ESL and Seniors ministry teams. Guard and protect them as they prepare regularly to serve Your people and help us all to receive their ministry for the building up of the Body in unity. 

We pray for Tim Angelico after his successful appendix operation yesterday, for his full recovery and prompt return to home and work. We pray also for others who can't be with us today - Muriel, Bruce, Diane, Eng Lin & Mae, Kum Seng and Yvonne, and others as they travel.

We pray that we may leave this place today as people changed by Your Word, ready at all times to bring honour to the Name of Jesus, in Whose Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring us our next reading today from John's Gospel.
