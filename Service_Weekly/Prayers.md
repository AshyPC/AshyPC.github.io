## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 14th October 2018

__1 Chron. 28:20__ 
_David also said to Solomon his son, 'Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the Lord is finished._

Let us remember that God is with us as we pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You today that You do not fail us of forsake us but You remain true to Your promises to us. We thank You that we can come into Your Presence, not as isolated individuals but as a community of believers, called together to be Your church in this place, brought together only because of the sacrifice of Jesus Your Son on the Cross, and His resurrection from the dead. We thank You that He reigns from heaven, that the Holy Spirit brings His life to us and enables His love to be shed abroad in our hearts, so that we can show the world what it is to glorify You, as You intend for all of Your Creation.

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world which mostly believes that life is cheap. We thank You that children are a heritage from the Lord, and precious in Your sight. We thank You for the peaceful rallies in Brisbane and Melbourne yesterday which sought to show that unborn babies have a right to life just as we all do. We thank You for the peaceful conduct of the rallies, and for the excellent work of the Police as they upheld the law.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us. We pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries and we seek Your strength and courage to do the work of the Kingdom. Help us to keep in sight the end result - the service of the temple of the Lord where people from every background and nation and language come together in unity to worship You. 

We want to be sure that everything we do - Seniors centre, Youth and Young Adults, ESL, Sunday School - upholds the Name of Jesus in Whose Great Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring us our second reading today.
