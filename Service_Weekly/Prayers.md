## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 17th October 2021

__Psalm 121:1‭-‬3__ _I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; From where shall my help come? My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the Only God, Who made the heavens and the earth. We thank You that You watch over Your people continually, and You are our sure source of help in times of trouble. 

We know that we live in a fallen world, broken by sin but redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Who was slain, Jesus our Lord. He is the Alpha and Omega, Who holds the keys of death and Hades, so that we need not fear. We may stumble but You are there to hold us steady.

We thank You that we can keep in touch and participate in different ways in worship, and we look forward to a time when we can meet in person once again.

Whether it is a virus we can’t see or gloomy news from around the world which seems to overwhelm us, we thank You that You are above all and rule over all, so that we need not despair.

### The Wide World 
We continue to pray for the persecuted believers in this world. Your Church suffers in Nigeria, Pakistan, India, China and elsewhere. In different ways Your people suffer even in Canada and Europe as well. Grant them grace as they share in the sufferings of Christ our Lord, standing firm in their faith in Him.

Yet we also give thanks that the Gospel is preached, the Kingdom expands and souls are saved in those places.

### ... and in the wider Church
We pray for Your Church as lockdowns continue here in Victoria, and give thanks for progress with vaccinations so that restrictions are eased interstate. We pray that Your Church would remain strong in the face of the limitations imposed on daily life.

We give thanks for the extensive deliberations of the wider body of Christ over the last two weeks in General Assemblies. We pray that the work of Your church might continue despite the new restrictions on workers, and pray that You would lift up and encourage those affected by the extra vaccination requirements.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You that You sustain us day by day. We continue to pray for Shiun as he progresses in recovery and we give thanks for Aashs’s mum in India who has recovered also.

We pray for the international students at Holmesglen. May the food parcels be a sustaining blessing to them, and we look for further opportunities to work with and support them as they study.

We pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. Help us to see how we can raise a Godly standard, bringing forgiveness and mercy to a world which is starved for reconciliation and peace.

In the Name of Jesus, the Prince of Peace we pray all these things, Amen.
