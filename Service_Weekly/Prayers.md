## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 7th September 2025

**Psalm 50:23** 
_The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me;_
_to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!”_

We come now to a time of prayer, to acknowledge God’s greatness, His perfection, to confess our imperfection, and to bring our requests to Him Who alone is able to effect lasting change, according to His purposes for the world and for us within it.

**Adoration**
God Almighty, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Creator of all that is, we Your creatures dare to come before You only because You are merciful, faithful and righteous. From everlasting to everlasting, You alone are God, all-powerful, all-seeing, all-holy and altogether just! If we were to rely on Your justice, we would be lost, for we are fallen, warped by sin into self-centredness, so that of ourselves we would not seek You out.

**Confession**
But because You are all-loving, and graciously merciful, we are not destroyed. We look back upon our week and recognise the times when we have failed, when we have not been holy as You are holy, when we have shamed the Name of Jesus our Saviour, when we have put down another person, thinking less of them and more of ourselves, when we have given in to temptation. We are ashamed of our thoughts, words and deeds and freely confess them to You now.

**Thanksgiving**
Yet, we thank You that You have not abandoned us to our condition but rescued us from oblivion. We thank You for the special grace of salvation: while we were still sinners, Jesus came as the Sinless Perfect Son of God and Son of Man to take our place and suffer the penalty which we deserved, dying in our stead so we could go free.

We thank You that You raised Him up on the third day, defeating death and sin, and beginning the restoration of what was Your perfect creation. We thank You that there will be an end to sin when Jesus returns and institutes the new heaven and the new earth. Thereafter, we Your redeemed people and Your restored Creation will show forth Your glory without limit, forever and ever.

**Supplication: The Wider World**
In the wider world, we continue to pray for the expansion of the Kingdom via the preaching of Your Word. We give thanks that the tragedy of the assassination of Charlie Kirk in the USA has resulted in many people turning to you for answers, and we pray that those who hunger for righteousness will be satisfied through the many churches which have seen great increases in attendances.

But we are also alert to the work of a defeated enemy, once again seeing a “victory” turn to another defeat, much as happened when John the Baptist was beheaded, and the Lord Jesus healed so many, and His followers greatly increased in number.

**... and the wider Church**
We pray for Your people in churches so that they may minister faithfully to those who seek answers to such senseless tragedies. Encourage them and enable them to speak to the hearts of those who are perplexed, so that doubts can be replaced by faith and hope. Strengthen us also, and keep us faithful when we don’t understand Your sovereign purposes. We give thanks for the great turnaround, as we decry the hatred that has also emerged from those who opposed Charlie’s courageous, faithful stand for the Lord Jesus in such a public manner. 


**Supplication: Ashburton**
Here in Ashburton we pray for ourselves as we seek a faithful preacher of Your Word, and we pray for our Selection Committee as the work on our behalf. Grant them wisdom, insight and unity in their search.

We thank You for John as he brings Your Word to us today. May we be diligent in hearing and following Your Word, as we take it to heart, and live it out day by day. We pray that our fellowship continues to grow stronger each week, both in Sunday worship and in our community involvements. We pray for those of our number in need of Your healing hand. Whether that healing comes directly or by means of doctors and medicines, we give You thanks as we recognise that You are the True Healer.

Finally, we pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We thank You that we are a part of the work of spreading the Good News, and members of the world-spanning Body of Christ. May we grow to show the character of our Risen Lord so well that others will see Him rather than us.

In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
