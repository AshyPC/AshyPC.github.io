## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 138:7__ _Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes; with your right hand you save me._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, You are the Only God, the Creator, and the Sustainer of all that You have made. We thank You that You are sovereign over this world and we are here to honour and worship the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 

We thank You that You created Adam and Eve and gave them the freedom to choose to love and serve You. And we thank You that we too have that much freedom, but we also know that it comes with a responsibility. When they chose to enthrone self over God, we likewise fell into a slavery to self. But for Your mercy, we would be completely wrapped up in ourselves. But You sent Jesus to rescue us from our impossible situation and turn us away from our selves to focus on Him.

### The World & The Church
We thank You that You have made us part of the household of God, and ambassadors for Christ. You have formed us into a body of the gathered elect, and we pray for Your Church which You have bound together by Your love. We pray that we might be fitting representatives of the new kingdom of heaven, loyal subjects of the King of Kings, showing that love as a living demonstration of this new Kingdom which will never end, so that others are drawn to it and not driven away from it.

Yet we live in a world which remains in rebellion against You, despite the evidence of Your Almighty creation. We know from Your Word that You draw people away from this world to Yourself. We pray for those in this world under the influence of Your Holy Spirit, who long for something better and who seek the Truth. We pray that we may bring them closer to Jesus with everything we do and say. It's not easy, for we face troubles, and there are those who deliberately oppose You, and vent their anger at Your church and Your people. But we trust that You will save, according to all Your perfect purposes.  We trust in Jesus' promise that He will build His church and guard it against the worst an enemy could do.

### Ashburton
We thank You Lord that You care for us here in Ashburton as individuals, even while You oversee Your whole creation. And so we ask for Your care for those who are in need - we remember Eric, Jim, Ruth, Hazel, Muriel. We also pray Your protection for Sandra and Newton as they travel. 

We thank You again for new students in our ESL classes. Guide us as we minister to them in English lessons as well as in understanding their needs and aspirations. We look for opportunities to serve them in spiritual things also. As our classes stretch our resources, we also pray for others to join us in the task of bringing them into contact with the Living Word, our Lord Jesus, in whose Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now we will move on to today's reading from second Samuel chapter 7. Please open your Bibles and follow as I read. If you are using a pew Bible the page number is on the screen.
