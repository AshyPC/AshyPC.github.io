## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 17th September 2017

__Psalm 63:3-4__ _Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
	I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we can come into Your Presence to praise You today, and every day. We acknowledge that You are our Maker, Redeemer and Sustainer. You give us Life and breath, You keep watch over us even when we sleep.

We thank You for Jesus the Perfect One Who died in our place, taking the penalty for our sin upon Himself. We thank You, Holy Spirit that You have taken up residence within, so we can by Your power be free of our past sinfulness, and can submit ourselves to Your will.

### Thanks for the Word
We thank You for Your Word which is fixed forever in the heavens, a sure foundation for our faith, true wisdom for our daily lives, and revealing to us the trustworthy knowledge of Your character, Your justice, Your mercy, Your love towards us.  

### The World and the Church
We thank You for the Church for which Jesus died, and to which He gave the charge to guard the Truth and to proclaim Your salvation to all the world. We thank You for the rich heritage we have received, for the cloud of faithful witnesses who won their own victories in spreading the Gospel, and who now cheer us on to win the same victory in today's world.  

We thank You for Jesus promise that the Church will stand against whatever the enemy can throw against it. We pray for Steve North and the Ballarat parish as they face the glare of publicity for standing firm on the truth of Your Word for marriage. Strengthen them all and grant them wisdom in dealing with hostile publicity and unfounded attacks. We continue to pray for Australian voters to be able to express their views in the postal survey, that those views will be accurately tallied, and that the Federal Parliament will only act in accordance with the result that emerges at the end of the survey time. 

We also pray for ourselves as we submit to Your Word, and we pray for Barry in his preaching, to bring out the true meaning for us to take to heart, and to live out day by day. Grant us the Godly wisdom we need to understand how to apply Your Word to our current circumstances.

### Ashburton
For our work here, we give thanks for the variety of ministries operating. We pray that even now we look forward and prepare for the next stage, as we prepare for the expansion of cross-cultural work and the renewal of support from the wider Presbyterian church. We pray for our own part in sharing the Gospel with those around us in the community, with those who come to ESL classes, and our Easy English Bible Study. May we be a body of people who reach out to those in need, so that in whatever we do, we glorify the Name of the King of Kings.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now Peng will be bringing us the second reading from God's Word.
