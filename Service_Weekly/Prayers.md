## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 28th March 2021

__2 Tim 2:13__ _...if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot disown himself._

This comes at the end of a “trustworthy saying” which Paul quoted to Timothy in his second letter.

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that we are free to meet again on this Lord’s Day to hear Your Word read and preached, to sing Your praises, and to share fellowship one with another.

We remember on this Palm Sunday that Jesus made a triumphal entry to the city of Jerusalem. He came, not as the military conquerors, but on a donkey, meek and lowly, as foretold by the prophet Zechariah. He was hailed by the crowd as the Messiah, the restorer of Israel. Yet, less than a week later, He would be rejected by a fickle crowd, stirred up by their leaders to demand the release of a murderer.

But He remained faithful to His mission, to endure the Cross on our behalf, and so become the Perfect sacrifice we needed in order to be rescued from our sin.

We confess that we would be no more faithful than those in the crowd, for we know too well our weaknesses and our sinful hearts. We are still prone to wander, Lord. Nevertheless, we look forward to the return of the Messiah, coming not on a donkey but as the King of Kings, leading His army of the redeemed on a white charger, victorious over sin and death.

### The Wider World...... and the wider Church ### 
In this wide world, Lord, we do not see a welcoming crowd – rather we see much opposition. We continue to pray for a world seeking comfort and entertainment in this life only. We pray for those who actively oppose the Church and want to remove the Name of Jesus completely. We pray for release for those whom You draw to Yourself. May we as members of Your Church be willing witnesses to Your glory and faithful ambassadors of the Kingdom of Heaven and our King of Kings.

As we live our lives here in submission to Your Word, Lord, we pray for our governments, for our nation and our State of Victoria. We give thanks for further easing of the Covid restrictions and for the fact that there have been no new cases for some time. We also pray for people in NSW and Queensland affected by the flooding rains. We pray for emergency relief, and for the restoration of what has been swept away.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. May we be faithful rather than faithless. We pray that our fellowship may grow stronger as we meet in community groups, as we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word. We know we won’t be fully perfected until Jesus returns but we seek the Holy Spirit to work Your grace within us daily.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen and absorb the living Word. May that living Word go deep into our hearts to change us by the work of the Holy Spirit, to make us more into the likeness of Jesus each day.

Knowing that we may make our plans but You guide our ways, we pray that the work of the Kingdom may prosper as Your Word extends outward from this place, In Jesus Name, Amen.
