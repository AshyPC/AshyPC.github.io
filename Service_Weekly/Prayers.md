## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 30th December 2018

Hosea 6:3__ 
_So ... let us press on to know the Lord. His going forth is as certain as the dawn; and He will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain watering the earth._


### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You have revealed Yourself to mankind, in various ways but most clearly in Your Son our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. You have also revealed to us our true condition in sin because of Adam's disobedience. And we know that we were under the same sentence of death as he was, because we followed his sin in our own lives.  

We celebrate at this season the fact that Jesus came to rescue us by accepting on our behalf the penalty which we deserved. By conquering death, He cancelled the power of sin so that we can grow to be the people You meant us to be. 

This is also the time when many look at the new year coming, and make brave resolutions to change, to make a fresh start. In our own strength such plans have little prospect of success. But with the prophet Hosea, we look to You Lord, as our sure hope. We want to know You more and more, and to know for ourselves the refreshing that comes from the life You give us.

We thank You for Your grace and mercy in giving us that New Life on account of Jesus' obedience and not according to our own righteousness. We thank You for the Presence of the Holy Spirit, Who  daily enables us to conquer temptation and live holy lives. We thank You also that You are there to minister Your forgiveness when we confess our failures and resume our walk with You, fixing our eyes upon Jesus, to become more and more like Him. 

### The World 
For this world, Lord, we pray for a realisation that there is no answer to the perplexities of modern life apart from Your Heavenly provision. We pray that the truth of Christmas will take hold so that more people would know that there is only One Name under heaven by which we must be saved - the Name of Jesus, and that people will turn away from riots and demonstrations, and instead will seek You.

We pray for our nation and our state, for our governments to govern and lead wisely, for the wisdom of Your Word to guide the thinking of ministers, parliametarians and public servants alike. We pray that the freedoms we enjoy - to gather freely, to uphold and preach what we believe - will be recognised and preserved for the good of all. 

### The Church
We pray for Your Church to shake off its sleepiness and wake up to the great task of proclaiming Your Truth clearly. We pray that the church would stop being lukewarm and instead to return to its first love, showing how people can change from enemies of God into friends and members of the family of God. 

### Ashburton
We pray for Barry as he preaches today, and for Mook, Talia, Jethro and Amy as they take a break. We pray for Barry and Suzanne as they prepare for some leave also. May it be a time of refreshing and rest as You continue to lead them daily.

For ourselves, we pray for boldness in speaking of Your love, and for strength to do what is right at all times, knowing that we are all called to be witnesses to Your great grace and mercy. May all that we do bring honour to the Name of Jesus, in Whose Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring us our next reading today from the Gospel of Matthew.
