## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 18th January 2026

**Psalm 28:1-2** 
_[1] To You, O Lord, we call; our rock, be not deaf to us, lest, if You be silent to us, we become like those who go down to the pit._
_[2] Hear the voice of our pleas for mercy, when we cry to You for help, when we lift up our hands toward Your most holy sanctuary._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You hear and answer when we call out to You. You are our secure Rock, our shelter, the Mighty One Who alone saves.

We turn to You for our eternal salvation, for we are sinners and in trouble in this world. We may not realise how much more terrifying are the spiritual forces which separate us from You, but We thank You for sending Jesus to die in our place, taking the penalty that belongs to us, since we were the ones who turned away from You.

We know that we could not save ourselves even in this world, where we see natural disasters in the form of floods, fires and tornados. We see the immense power of what many call “the forces of nature” and we rightly fear their terrible effects.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for those affected by floods and bushfires in other places. We still marvel that in one continent we can see both at the same time, and we give You thanks for all the emergency workers who have volunteered to help save life and property. We pray for those who have lost their own homes while defending others. And we pray for the residents in the fire areas who have been evacuated. They still have worries for their homes, their families and their neighbours.

We also pray for the flood victims, where even though no lives have been lost, there has been great loss of property. We also pray for the emergency services as they work hard to assist the victims with basic necessities.


**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we also labour with our various talents and abilities in the work of the Kingdom. Help us to keep our focus on the work of the Kingdom, as some plant, others water but You give the growth. We thank You for the work of the Blue Moose mission and the continuing work in St Arnaud. Thank You that the mission was able to continue despite the threat of fires round about, and we pray that the young people will not be distracted from reading the Bibles that they have received. May the various testimonies of the mission team plant good seed in the hearts of the residents so that the churches there may reap a harvest in due time.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, John, Russell and Jocelyn and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Brett as he preaches today. We pray that we would be diligent hearers and do-ers of Your Word, making the most of the means of grace.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
