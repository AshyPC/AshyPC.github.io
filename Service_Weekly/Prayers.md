## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 14th August 2022

__2 Cor 13:11__ 
_Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your eternal Presence with us wherever we go. We also thank You that we can come into Your Presence in this place specifically to worship together and to fellowship together as a united body of believers. As the world emerges from the shadow of the Covid virus and all its consequences, we thank You that we recognise the spiritual consequences, too. Now we seek to restore our fellowship, to comfort one another, agree with one another in peace as Paul encourages his Corinthian readers and us.

We thank You that Your love and peace surround us and that the Holy Spirit lifts us up and strengthens the bonds of peace between us.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we pray for peace also, even as we see so much turmoil and strife as the effects of sin work out in broken relationships one with another. 

We pray again for the restoration of peace, order and good government in Sri Lanka where Barnabus Fund works to help provide food and basic services to the people. And we cannot forget the situation in the Ukraine. We continue to pray for Lazlo and Eva Mihalyi working in Hungary to provide aid to fleeing refugees.

### Ashburton
We give thanks for the Church Camp last weekend. We thank You for Pete Sorensonâ€™s encouragement to hold fast to our sure hope in the Gospel. May we now apply that teaching to our daily lives, especially in the Revitalization Program and our new Bible Study series.

We again pray for the Revitalization program, as we look forward to Rod Morris coming to meet with us in two weeks time. Help us to be willing and active in the program, for we earnestly desire that it be a major means of the Kingdom of Heaven blessing more people, and seeing souls saved, as we submit to Your direction for our church.

We pray for those among us who need Your healing hand, especially remembering Diane and Shiun. Our bodies are fearfully and wonderfully made by You but we recognise that we are frail and subject to the effects of living in a fallen world, waiting for the manifestation of the redeemed people of God.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches today. Help us to take Your Word in, and grow in our undertanding of the church and our place in Your work here. So we pray in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, for Whose Kingdom we work in the strength You give us, Amen.
