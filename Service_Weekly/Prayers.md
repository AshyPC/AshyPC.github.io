## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 27th July 2025

__Psalm 112:6-7__ 
_[6] For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever._
_[7] He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we can come before the throne of grace, but only because we have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, and we are now deemed to be righteous because He has given us His Perfect righteousness. 

We thank You that we have been released from the old bondage to sin because of Your steadfast love, Your Perfect Goodness and Your gracious forgiveness.

Because of that, we thank You that we no longer need to be afraid of bad news, because we place our trust in You. We thank You that we can now be bearers of Good News.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We pray for this world where so many know the bad news but do not know that there is Good News, and a sure hope for the future. We pray that we have opportunities to counter despair with the hope of eternal life in Jesus. Help us to recognise when we may offer a word of encouragement, or even dare to ask if we might pray for a person in their situation.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for the ongoing work of Blue Moose missions – the winter mission just concluded and the summer mission to come in January. We thank You that we were able to support Jack and the team in St Arnaud with Bibles suited to the young people there. We pray that they would not be neglected but read regularly.

### Ashburton
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we work out how to apply the teaching of the Ripple Effect workshop, especially relating to our family, friends and neighbours. We pray for the growth of our numbers – for we see the empty chairs, and long for them to be filled with more people who have come to put their trust in Jesus.

We persist in prayer for Alan Freer, as he progresses in his rehabilitation, for Diane, as she begins exercises to restore the function in her shoulder, for Mook to fully recover from the ‘Flu, and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Mook’s preparation so that what he brings in his preaching today is not just intellectual study but Your living Word for us to feed upon spiritually. May it enable us to defend ourselves against temptation more effectively than we have done in the past. We pray that it will help us to worship more and more from hearts changed to be like our great High Priest as we work for the extension of the kingdom until Jesus returns.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
