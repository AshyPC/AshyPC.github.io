## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 15th Sep 2019 

Daniel, seeing that the seventy years of punishment were nearly over, set himself to confess the sins of the nation, and implore God's mercy.

__Daniel 9:7__ _"Righteousness belongs to You, O Lord, but to us open shame, as it is this day--to the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel, those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the countries to which You have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds which they have committed against You._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today, acknowledging Your righteousness and our shame. Like Daniel, we earnestly desire that Your people be restored and that this nation would display Your righteousness in obedience to the Word of Truth.  We thank You for Your mercy and grace so that we are not consumed in judgement. We thank You that Jesus took our place, suffered and died for our sins, and rose on the third day to glory. We thank You that our enemy is defeated and that Jesus reigns from on high. 

### The World and the Church
However, we confess the sins of our nation and our State where life is considered disposable, both for the unborn and for the elderly. We confess that we are a self-centred, materialist nation, which has turned its back on You, and substituted false religions for the true faith delivered once for all to the saints.

We pray for Your Church to be strong in the face of opposition and pressure to compromise with the Word. We see in this State many attacks upon believers, through the Parliament, against Christian schools, by distorted use of the legal system and by the direct sacking of employees who uphold Biblical standards. We see the hand of a defeated enemy who continues to wage war against God's people. We pray for those whom he uses to attack the Church - may they see what evil they are doing, and be brought to repentance by the work of the Holy Spirit. 

We pray for the many churches which have been invaded by worldly attitudes and compromise. We see much division, both within and between denominations and we pray that they may be turned around so that Your church would again be known as the Pillar of Truth in this community and this nation. We pray for the open showing of the holy nation, the people set apart to Your glory.

### Ashburton
We thank You, Lord that here we enjoy the blessings of faithful, powerful, Godly preaching. We continue to pray for Your protection and guidance for Barry and Mook, and we pray for ourselves to be faithful and true to Your Word also. May we be ever growing in Godliness so that we are known, like Daniel, to be people of integrity, without fault at home, at work, in studies and in our communities.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now MarJo will bring our second reading for today.
