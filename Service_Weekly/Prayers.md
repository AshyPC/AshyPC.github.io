## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 24th FEbruary 2019
__Romans 8:16__ _The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come before You today, remembering that we are no longer Your enemies, rebelling against Your good and perfect rule. We thank You that because of the perfect life, death and resurrection of Jesus we now are adopted children and members of the family of God. We count ourselves brethren of the Lord Jesus, Who is co-Creator and our coming King. We thank You that You have blessed us with the presence of the Holy Spirit, Who dwells within and reminds us of who we are in Jesus.

We pray that we would have our spiritual ears tuned to hear His voice clearly, despite the noise of the world around us. May we recognise His quiet voice more and more as we read, meditate on and study Your Word, but also as we go about our daily activities, when we could become so busy that we forget to listen for Him.

### The World and the Church

We pray for Your Church to be strong, and that various denominations would make a firm stand on the solid foundation of Your Word. 

We also pray for Keith and Jenny Bell, who lost their daughter Susannah to a massive stroke about a week ago. We thank You that Sussanah is at peace but we ask that You keep Keith and Jenny and the family strong as they cope with the tragic suddenness of the loss. Comfort them in their grief and bless them with the spiritual and practical support of their fellow believers at this time.   

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We pray for the Community groups which commenced this week, that they grow stronger and that each person may know Your presence and leading in the closeness of fellowship one with another. 
We pray also for the work of ESL as Evelyn takes up the role of Co-ordinator this year. Lead and guide her in that task, bless the teachers and draw more students to the classes, and may we all find ways to share in the ministry of helping people with their conversational English. We pray also for the planning of a Famly Fun Day and more film nights to help us witness locally to families in the community around the church.

We also pray for those of our number who are in need of Your particular love and care. We especially pray for Muriel, Bruce, Diane and Ken.

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Eric will bring our second reading for today.
