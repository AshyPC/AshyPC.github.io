## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 7th November 2021

__Zechariah 1:17__ _Cry out again, Thus says the Lord of hosts: ’My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.’_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the God of all comfort, Who cares deeply for Your Creation. We thank You that You watch over Your people continually, despite all the failings of a fallen human race.

We know that we live in a world broken by sin but redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Who was slain, Jesus our Lord. He is the Victor over sin and death so that we need not fear. Whether it is a virus we can’t see or gloomy news which seems to overwhelm us, or rulers seeking to displace the King of Kings, we thank You that You are above all and rule over all, so that we need not despair.

### The Wide World 
We continue to pray for the persecuted believers in this world. It is distressing to so easily list ten nations where our fellow believers are under physical persecution. We give thanks that we only suffer moderate inconveniences by comparison.

This week we focus on Ethiopia, which heard the Gospel very early from Philip the Evangelist. Today there are many refugee camps where workers are bringing the Good News again but there is much civil unrest. We pray for the health and safety of the workers bringing both physical and spiritual aid to the refugees.

### ... and in the wider Church
We pray for Your Church as lockdown regulations are lifted here in Victoria, but new restrictions create divisions between vaccinated and unvaccinated. Meanwhile restrictions are reimposed interstate and there is still much concern over travel bans and border controls. We continue to pray that Your Church would remain strong in the face of these limitations and that we may be able to meet all together as soon as possible.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You that You sustain us day by day. We look forward to holding an outdoor Carols service in December, as and when restrictions are lifted further.

We pray for the Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes which are going to Cambodia this year. We thank You that we have been able to prepare 60 boxes despite the lockdowns.

We continue to pray for Shiun as he progresses in recovery and for Diane’s health while her treatment continues. We bring before You Sueie and her family as they grieve the passing of her sister-in-law last week. We ask also that You would sustain her brother at this time.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we face the kind of difficulties which Peter’s readers also faced in their time. As we listen we pray for the strength to live according to Your Word when it is no longer easy to do. Help us to see how we can raise a Godly standard, bringing forgiveness and mercy to a world which is starved for reconciliation and peace.

In the Name of Jesus, the Prince of Peace we pray all these things, Amen.
