## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 8th September 2024

__Psalm 50:23 & Hebrews 13:15__ 
    _The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!‚Äù_

    _Through Him [Jesus] then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge His name._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we come to You today, bringing our sacrifice of thanks to glorify Your Name. But we come not as the Psalmist bringing a lamb or a bull, but we bring praises for Jesus Who offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for us and our sins. We thank You that our salvation rests on His once and for all RIGHT sacrifice, and not on our own good works, which count as nothing in the light of Your Perfect holiness.

We thank You that Jesus took the punishment, paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give is His righteousness, His endless life. According to Your eternal purposes we now have the Holy Spirit within, ministering His life to us, purging us of every stain and sanctifying us to be fit for heaven when He returns.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for our news media are swamped with fearful talk of international crises, or try to distract us with entertainment and sport. We pray instead for a sober understanding and a realization that You remain in control. We remind ourselves that we are called to remain steadfast under Your care, to hold to the truth that the gospel continues to save lives as people come to faith in Jesus all over the world. 

We pray for His Majesty King Charles, with a Royal Visit sheduled for October. We respect his high office but remember that he is subject to the same human frailties as we do, and we pray for his ongoing cancer treatment. We continue to pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You, and to recocnise the True King of kings, Jesus.

This month we support the work of Samaaritans Purse through Operation Christmas Child, as they work to bring Your Word to children by the gift of shoeboxes. We thank You for the True Gift of Jesus and His salvation for all who believe. 

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to grow in Godliness and obedience to Your Word, and we pray for all taking part in the Hope Explored series commencing today. Grant them understanding of the sure hope we share in the good news of Jesus certain return.

We thank You Lord for Levi and the skilled work of the medical team monitoring his progress. We pray that, as they adapt his medication, he will enjoy better sleep and allow Steph and Callum to rest also.

We thank You for Joshua Lyddy bringing Your Word to us today. We pray that his preparation will bear fruit among us in greater boldness to share the good news of our gracious loving Father, our eternal High Priest, Jesus, and our Ever-Present Guide, the Holy Spirit. In Jesus Precious Name we ask all these things, Amen.
