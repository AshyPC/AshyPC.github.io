## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 25th March 2018

__Psalm 40:1-3__ 
_I waited patiently for the Lord; He turned to me and heard my cry.
 He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire;
 He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.
 Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him._

(of David)

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are the Only God, the Gracious God Who hears our prayers.
We thank You that You have put a new song into our mouths, and therefore we have come into Your House to praise and worship You.

We thank You that Jesus, the Eternal Son, came into our world as one of us to bring that salvation to us, to reconcile us to Yourself. As we come to the Easter season when we especially remember, we thank You that He did not shrink from the Cross, but took the penalty that was due to us, so that we may be free of the guilt and the power and the penalty of our sin. 

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world and the work of the church in serving the Kingdom. We know that this world will not be free of sin until Jesus returns to take His Kingship visibly and bring righteoous judgement to all. As we observe more and more attempts to restrict the Church and attack Your people, we pray that our hymns of praise may declare the Truth, and that we may continue to declare the Good News, as ambassaddors of the Kingdom of Heaven.

If we wish to be a healthy nation, we must return to You, Lord, for there is only One Way to the Father. We pray for a turnaround in our land, and we thank You for the opportunity afforded by the Easter season. May Your Church declare the Truth, graciously recall people to the Cross, show compassion for the lost and shepherd them as Your flock, to Your eternal praise and glory.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us as part of Your great work to win souls. As we show forth the unity of the Body of Christ, help us to demonstrate the way the Kingdom of Heaven operates, and to work within Your purposes for this area. We pray for the ESL program and thank You for new students, we pray for the Seniors ministry, as they reach out to people and we pray again that You might open the closed doors at the Holmesglen TAFE, so that we may bring good news to those in need of ministry there.

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Nam will bring our second reading from God's Word today, continuing in Luke chapter 19.
