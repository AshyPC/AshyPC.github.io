## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 30th January 2022

__Romans 12:2__ 
_Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come to You today, very much aware that we are weak and limited in so many ways. Yet You remain ever-sovereign over our circumstances. We waver but You never change, We thank You that You are ever-gracious and draw us to Yourself the True, Faithful, Purposeful and Loving God of glory.

Today and every day we honour the Lord Jesus as the King of Kings. We remember His victory on the Cross and in the Resurrection, and we give You thanks that He ascended to the Throne Room of Heaven, awaiting the right time to return as the Visible Supreme Authority over all. We thank You that He is the Source of Life to us, and our Great High Priest Who intercedes for us. And we give thanks that You have granted us His life and righteousness in place of our sin, rebellion and self-centredness.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
As we look about this world we again hear of threats and rumours of wars. Despite all diplomatic efforts, we see that leaders are perplexed at current events, and man cannot ultimately solve his own problems. This world needs the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. Mankind needs to bow to Your Supreme Authority, but meanwhile we continue to pray for Your grace and mercy in this broken world.

May Your Church be seen as the model for relationships at all levels: may our congregations be places where heaven and earth meet, where the cross and the resurrection are declared as Your provision to save the lost, and where transformed people submit to the reign of the Lord Jesus in  their lives daily.

We continue to pray for the cleanup work after the Queensland floods and for the same cleanup after yesterdayâ€™s storm here. We give thanks for the emergency services work in bringing people to safety and restoring services.

We thank You again for Your mercy as we see the decline in Covid cases around the nation. We pray for wider availability of testing kits and for care with their use. We pray also for further easing of restrictions as cases in hospital decline and pressure on staff eases.

### Missions 
We pray for PresAID as our missions focus for January. We thank You for the support going to provide village water supply in India. We are flooded and unable to control the overflows, and yet there are so many places without safe clean water.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for students who are about to return to school or commence lessons. We pray for Your protection and safety under the Covid restrictions, and that they can apply themselves to their work with all diligence and faithfulness.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Kum Seng and Josh, and Diane and Shiun. We pray for their continuing recovery and rehabilitation back to full health.

And now we pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word today. As we listen we pray for wisdom and discernment, that we may live transformed lives wherever You direct us to go in this world, and honouring the Name of Jesus, the King of Kings, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
