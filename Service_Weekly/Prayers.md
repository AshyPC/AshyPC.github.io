## Prayers for our World and the Church

John 11:25__ _...I am the Resurrection and the Life..._


### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that we can come into Your Presence today, but that is only because of Jesus, the Resurrection and the Life. We thank You that His death was not the end but that His resurrection demonstrated that Life is greater than death, that Your righteousness is greater than our sinfulness and that Your grace is beyond our understanding.

We remember during this season the fact that Jesus came to rescue us by accepting on our behalf the penalty which we deserved. By conquering death, He cancelled the power of sin so that we can receive His righteous life in exchange and so grow to be the people You meant us to be. 

We thank You for Your grace and mercy in giving us that New Life on account of Jesus' obedience and not according to our own righteousness. We thank You for the Presence of the Holy Spirit, Who  daily enables us to conquer temptation and live holy lives. We thank You also that You are there to minister Your forgiveness when we confess our failures and resume our walk with You, fixing our eyes upon Jesus, to become more and more like Him. 

### The World 
For this world, Lord, we pray for a realisation that there is no answer to the perplexities of modern life apart from Your Heavenly provision. We see the tragedy in New Zealand and learn something of how bad sin is but then we look at the Cross to learn how You have dealt with it, so that we do not have to fall for temptations to take matters into our own hands.

We pray for our nation and for the new government in NSW, that our governments would govern and lead wisely. We pray for the wisdom of Your Word to guide the thinking of ministers, parliamentarians and public servants alike. We pray that they understand that they work for the good of the people of this nation, and not for themselves. We pray that the freedoms we enjoy - to gather freely, to uphold and preach what we believe - will be recognised and preserved for the good of all. 

### The Church
We pray for Your Church to shake off its sleepiness and wake up to the great task of proclaiming Your Truth clearly. We thank You for the strong teaching and vigorous training of our Theological College, and we pray for the approaching Graduation Ceremony. We thank You for those students moving out to parishes to begin their preaching ministries, and we pray that You would raise up more workers to commit to training for the ministry.

We especially want to pray for Keith and Jenny Bell facing a new difficulty, as another of their daughters undergoes treatment for cancer. Uphold them and all the Bell family we pray; keep them strong in their faith, and may they cling to You more firmly during this time.

### Ashburton
We pray for Barry as he preaches today, and thank You for his work in prayer and preparation. We pray that we too may come prepared to take in Your Word, ready to hear and quick to submit as the Holy Spirit prompts us towards greater sanctification.

We pray that we can leave this place ready with boldness to speak of Your love, and strength to do what is right at all times, knowing that we are all called to be witnesses to Your great grace and mercy wherever we go. May all that we do bring honour to the Name of Jesus, in Whose Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Gaye will bring us our next reading today from the Ephesians.
