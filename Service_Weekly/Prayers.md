## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 80:2-3__ _Awaken your might; come and save us. Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are indeed the Mighty One, the champion of Israel, the God Who saved them. So many times when Your people were oppressed and they turned back to You, You shone Your face upon them and lifted them up. We look back at that history and recall Your faithfulness to Your covenant promises.

We thank You for Jesus, Who came to seek and save the lost, not in power but in humility. To redeem us through the Cross, He set aside His power, the legions of heavenly angels, and His own will, and submitted Himself to the lower authorities of this world, in order to obey Your will on our behalf.

We thank You Holy Spirit for Your constant Presence with us, which is not as the nation knew You, when You withdrew Your presence in their times of sin and faithlessness. We long to be ever aware that You are with us, guiding, directing, teaching us, bringing us closer to the likeness of Jesus every day.

### The World & The Church
We see in Your Word that Jesus stood alone against the worst that the world could give. We pray for this world which continues to ignore its true king and instead chases after other lesser kings. As we know Your constant Presence, Your care and love for all Your creation, we pray that we can show Your character of love, grace and mercy so that others can come to know You too.

We thank You, Holy Spirit that You have placed us within Your Church and we reecognise Your Presence within others so that we may have fellowship together, and so that others may see that we serve one another instead of ourselves. We no longer have to "look out for Number one" but we are able to encourage one another.

### Ashburton
During this school holiday break, we continue to pray for our ESL students, and especially for Suzanne who is still seeking work to fulfill her visa requirements. We pray for Mook and Ashley as they settle into the area and build local relationships. 

We pray for those amongt us in need of Your healing hand. We especially pray for Jim Gleeson and Muriel French with their heart troubles. We thank You for the care they receive.

As we pray Lord, we remember that You are Perfectly good, and that everything You do in our lives has a good and eternal purpose. Help us to work with You rather than against You, so that we may see Your purposes fulfilled, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles as Gaye McKenzie brings us today's second reading, which will be from Matthew chapter 25.
