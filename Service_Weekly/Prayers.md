## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 15th March 2020 

__Psalms 34:3-4, 7__ _O magnify the Lord with me And let us exalt His name together. I sought the Lord, and He answered me And delivered me from all my fears... The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him And rescues them._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that, despite the escalating concerns over the coronavirus, and the spreading incidences of infection, we are able to continue to gather together as Your people, to worship You and to hear Your Word read and preached. 

We thank You that You remain in control of the situation and are still sovereign over our lives and circumstances.

We confess that there is a lot of fear in this nation, expressed in examples of panic-buying because so few truly know You and put their trust in You.

### The Wider World ### 
We continue to pray today for the grave situation seen in other places. We pray for people in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy, where conditions are much more severe than we see here in Australia. We thank You for the advice we receive regularly and we pray that the response will continue to match the seriousness of this pandemic.

We pray for strength and endurance for the medical response teams dealing with these outbreaks, as well as those seeking a remedy or vaccine. We also pray for those afflicted and for the unknowing carriers to receive treatment as well as for the preventative measures to be taken.

### and the wider Church ###
We pray that Your people everywhere may be diligent in following all precautionary medical advice without fear or panic so that we express our trust in You in everything we do. May we all express that same trust in You which David wrote in this Psalm, and that this trust may spread to others so that Your Church can be "salt and light" and a blessing to those who do not know You. 

### Ashburton
Here in this place, we pray for ourselves also. Strengthen and encourage us to be faithful and true to Your Word, even though we may not face the same direct threat seen in other parts of the world.

We pray for wisdom for the Session, Board and other leaders as we all await further advice. We pray that the ESL classes and Seniors ministry may continue even as we take all necessary extra precautions. 

Guard us as You guarded Your pilgrim people we pray.  

In everything we do, whether in good times or in difficult times such as these, may we strive to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.

And now it is time for our second Bible reading for today.
