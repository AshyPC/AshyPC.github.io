## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 7th December 2025

**Luke 2:9-10** 
_9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear._
_10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You are infinitely powerful, the great Creator of the entire universe, yet You care for us in love and mercy. As we enter the Advent season, we acknowledge that we need a Saviour, and that You are the One and Only saviour Who could deal with our sin condition.

We see some of Your power in the angel who appeared to the shepherds, causing them to tremble at his awesome appearance. But we also thank You that he said “Fear not!” because he was bringing “good news of great joy” and we take his message for ourselves today. For we know that there is much in this world which could cause us to fear – things large and small which hold us back, events beyond our understanding, tragedies which could overwhelm us. But because of the good news of the birth of The Saviour, we have assurance that bad news will end some day, that Your gracious love and mercy will overcome evil, and sin and death will not have the final say over us.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
As we rejoice in the coming of Jesus, we pause to pray for the bushfire situation in NSW, and ask that You would extend Your mercy to those affected, and comfort those who have lost their homes.

We pray Your protection for the firefighters on the ground and in the air as they work hard to bring the infernos under control. Guard them as they put themselves at risk on behalf of the residents.

We pray for those in the background providing support, and for Your people in churches as they move to help restore what has been lost. Strengthen them as they show Your love in practical ways to the people whose homes and belongings have been destroyed.


**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we prepare for the Carols on the Lawn event. Strengthen us as we work to bring Your Word to residents around us via the songs of this season.

We continue to pray for those in need of Your healing hand – we remember Alan and Diane, each dealing with the results of their falls, John McKenzie undergoing regular treatment, Russell and Jocelyn recovering from their exertions, and the children – Clarissa recovering from her operation, Levi having to take regular medication, and others affected by illnesses.

We thank You for Your Word, and for Douglas as he preaches today. We thank You for John writing to the church but also for his longing for personal fellowship. May we take to heart the importance of the relationships we build within the Body of Christ.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.

As we will shortly take part in the Lord’s Supper, let is recall the fundamentals of our faith by reciting The Apostle’s Creed:

I believe in God, the Father almighty,
      creator of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
      who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
      and born of the virgin Mary.
      He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
      was crucified, died, and was buried;
      he descended to hell.
      The third day he rose again from the dead.
      He ascended to heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.
      From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
      the holy catholic* church,
      the communion of saints,
      the forgiveness of sins,
      the resurrection of the body,
      and the life everlasting. Amen.
