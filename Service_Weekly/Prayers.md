## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 22nd October 2020 

__Psalms 130:1-2__ _YOut of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, You are high and lifted up. You created all that was good in the beginning. Yet the Creation was plunged into the futility caused by Adam's sin, and today we live in an imperfect world, where sin and sickness are never far from us.

We confess that, like sheep, we have gone astray and turned away from You, the true source of Life. We live still under the limitations of Covid restrictions and all our efforts to overcome the impact of the virus are man-centred.

However, we thank You that You rescued us from the depths of our sin by sending Jesus to take our place. We thank You that by Your glorious grace, You have dealt with the basic cause: our sin against You. You delivered us by raising Jesus from the dead. By the same power which created the world, You transferred us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Your Son.

By implanting Your Holy Spirit You have given us the righteous life of Jesus, and You have adopted us into the heavenly Family.

We thank You that we can still worship with the help of technology and that we are still able to sing Your praises in our separated places. By giving You the first day of the week we signify that we give You the first priority over all our plans, over everything in our lives.

### The Wider World ... ### 
We thank You that conditions in Victoria are improving as the number of reported Covid cases falls steadily each day. We thank You that the State has gone 23 days without a new case and we continue to pray for our leaders and their medical advisers. We look forward to the scaling back of restrictions, possibly as early as tonight. We are encouraged by the news we hear of early success with vaccines, and pray for further progress with various treatments.

### ... and the wider Church ###
In the wider church, we pray for missionaries and their families in countries without the same standard of medical and hospital care. We pray for the Mathys family in Papua New Guinea. May they and all at the Ukarumpa Wycliffe base be safe and may they resume Bible translation and related work.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we give thanks that we remain generally healthy but remember that there are other matters of health and well-being to pray for. We give thanks for Margaret's recovery, and for the excellent medical care available to her. 

We continue to pray for our students as they progress through the VCE exam period. Please enable Shi Yar and Thea to present themselves at their best. May they have confidence as they perservere in these exams.

We uphold Barry, Mook and all the team preparing our video services. We also pray for the Elders and the Board as they plan for restoration of services in person, and all that needs to be done for that to happen.

We strive to endure all things, including the restrictions, for the sake of the Kingdom and for the glory of the King of Kings, Amen.
