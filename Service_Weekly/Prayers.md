## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 30th September 2018

__Psalm 115:1-3__ 
_Not to us, Lord , not to us but to Your Name be the glory, because of Your love and faithfulness. Why do the nations say, 'Where is their God?' Our God is in heaven; He does whatever pleases Him._

Let us give glory to God as we pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come before You today not to give ourselves glory but to give You the glory that is due to Your Name. We thank You that You are the Maker of all things, the Sustainer of the entire creation, and that You made us and all creatures to glorify You.

We come into Your Presence only because You are Faithful and True, and You love us even though we do not deserve anything. For because of Adam's sin we were rebels, not interested in glorifying You as we should but only wanting to satisfy ourselves.

You did not leave us dead in sin - instead You sent Jesus, Your own Son, to take our place, to bear our punishment, the penalty of death that our sins deserved and then You raised Him from the dead to give us New Life which we did not deserve. 

We thank You that You didn't leave us when Jesus returned to heaven to take His throne, but You gave us Your continuing Presence in the Holy Spirit to guide us, teach us and sanctify us daily. We thank You that You are faithful in keeping us, and we pray that we may persevere to the end.

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world which continues to turn its back on You. Many dare to taunt Your people asking "Where is your God?" not fearing Your justice and we pray earnestly that their eyes be opened to Your greatness and their danger in the coming judgement, that they might be turned from enemies into friends.  

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us. We thank You and pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries - Seniors centre, Youth and Young Adults, ESL, Sunday School, and missionary support. We want to be sure that everything we do honours Your Name, upholds the cause of Jesus and extends the Kingdom to more and more people. May we be a true beacon of the One Who is the Light of the World.

In all these activities, You call us to remain faithful and true, and that is what we pray in Jesus Precious Name, Amen.
