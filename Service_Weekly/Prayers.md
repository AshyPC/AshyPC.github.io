## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 27th February 2022

__Hebrews 12:1-2__ 
_Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith..._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come before You today, thanking You Who remain ever-sovereign over our circumstances. We thank You for the cloud of witnesses, the many faithful servants who encourage us to persevere. We recognise that we struggle under every weight, and know the sin which clings so closely, making it difficult for us to even remember that we are in a race with an eternal destiny before us. We thank You that You are ever-gracious to supply us with everything we need to achieve victory as we look to Jesus.

Today and every day we honour Him as Lord, as the King of Kings. We remember His victory on the Cross and in the Resurrection, and we give You thanks that His perfect victory has been bequeathed to us by Your adoption. We thank You that He is the Source of Life to us, and our Great High Priest Who intercedes for us, even as He leads us.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
This week we look about this world which is again at war. And we see news of an earthquake in Indonesia, plus torrential rain and floods in Australia, and still news of the Covid virus. It’s as if our Bibles have become today’s newspapers.

We pray for the emerging refugee situation in the Ukraine, especially for the aid workers being mobilised to help, and for the people displaced from this new war zone. May they quickly find a safe haven away from the fighting.

We continue to pray for the Queensland flood situation and for the emerging situation in Northern NSW. We give thanks for the emergency services work in bringing people to safety and restoring services. And we pray for safety for those emergency volunteers, as we hear that one rescuer was drowned while trying to save others. We pray also for Your people in the flood areas – enable them to provide aid to those who have lost homes and possessions to the torrential rains.

We thank You again for Your mercy as we see the decline in Covid cases around the nation. We give thanks for the relaxed mask rules, and pray for further easing of restrictions as hospital cases  decline further. We pray for effective measures to deal with “long Covid” and slow recoveries which some people are going through, and we pray for our chaplaincy ministries as people turn to Yoou for comfort and guidance in confronting this tiny invader which has such a big effect.

### Missions 
We pray for PresAID as our missions focus for January. We thank You for the support going to provide village water supply in India. We are flooded and unable to control the overflows, and yet there are so many places without safe clean water.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for the commencement of our community groups soon. Enable us all to grow in fellowship, caring for one another, praying and encouraging one another as we learn more from Your Word andthen put it into practice daily.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Shiun, and for Diane after a recent time in hospital. We pray for their continuing recovery and rehabilitation back to full health. We also remember Shon’s protective visa application and continue to seek the immigration minister’s favour in granting Shon full permission to stay in Australia.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. As we listen we pray for wisdom and discernment, knowing that we live always in the shadow of the Cross, guided by the light of the Resurrection, so that whatever we do will honour the Name of Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, in Whose Name we pray all these things, Amen.
