## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 1st October 2017

__Psalms 72:17__ _May His name endure forever; May His name increase as long as the sun shines;  And let men bless themselves by Him; Let all nations call Him blessed._
_Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; Behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust. Isaiah 40:15_

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
Father God, we gather today to happily fulfill the command of Jesus our Saviour to celebrate the Supper and, as often as we do, to remember that He has come once and will surely come again.

### Thanks for the Word
We thank You for Your Word which stands firm forever, and reveals to us Your Character and Your actions in this world You have created. We thank You for the encouragement we receive to bless others in Your Name, as well as to see You blessed by all the nations.

### The World and the Church
We thank You for Your Church which is Your chosen instrument to reveal the true nature of Your love for mankind. You  love us so much that You sent Jesus as our Redeemer, even though You knew we were rebellious sinners. But You then begin Your sanctifying work in us to change us from enemies into friends, You adopt us into Your heavenly family, then commission us to be Your ambassadors to others who are still lost and blinded by sin. May we wear the Name of "Christian" with honour, and may all that we do be a true reflection of the character and grace of our Lord Jesus, Whose Name we carry.

### Ashburton
Marg Sanders, Jim Gleeson
As we gather around the table shortly we pray for those who can't be with us, in particular we lift up Margaret Sanders and Jim Gleeson both not well at this time. We pray Your mercy and protection for those travelling and we ask Your comfort for those in need of care and fellowship, especially Muriel French, Ruth Morrow, Hazel McGrath. As we enjoy the freedom to gather together, we pray also for those whom You have called to the mission field, away from the comforts of home as they sometimes sense the loneliness of solitary Christian service. And in doing so, we thank You that we can bring our burdens to You, and You can be present where we cannot.

In Jesus Matchless Name we pray, Amen.

And now Peng will bring our next reading from God's Precious Word.
