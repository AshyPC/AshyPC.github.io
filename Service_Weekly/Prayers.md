## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 29th October 2023

__Psalm 122:6-7__ 
_Pray for the peace of Jerusalem “May they be secure who love you!_
_Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!”_
From a Psalm of David expressing his desire for Godly peace)

### Thanks to God
Sovereign God, we thank You for Your Creation, and acknowledge Your rule over all that Your hands have made. We remember that You are the Only God, the One Who lifts up nations and puts down nations, according to Your holy purposes. You also care for us as individuals, we who need your grace daily.

We thank You that You sent Jesus to redeem us, so that we could exchange our unrighteousness for His Perfect Righteousness. We are only too aware that we are not perfect in ourselves, but merely sinners saved by grace. But we thank You that we can enter Your holy Presence, bringing our petitions to Your Throne of Grace, to receive mercy and help in our time of need.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In this world at this time, we especially pray for the peace of Jerusalem. We confess the sin of those who express such hatred of one people that they live only to violently remove them from this earth. We are ashamed that some of this was seen in the streets of our cities, barely eighty years after many nations united to say “Never Again!”

Despite the bad news we see and hear daily, we thank You that Your Word is preached in so many places around the world, that the Kingdom advances daily and that the Prince of Peace is honoured in ever-increasing numbers, in sincerity and truth.

### Mt Magnet
We pray for the work of PIM in Mt Magnet, via Alvin & Narelle. Strengthen them as they labour to win more people with the Good News of sure hope of Jesus. May the church progress like the Thessalonians, steadfast and faithful in whatever circumstances may arise.

### Operation Christmas Child
We thank You that the gospel is Your powerful means of turning people from enemies into adopted members of Your family. We pray today for the shoeboxes which will carry the Good News of Jesus to children in countries where we cannot go ourselves. We pray that the gifts will be received gladly, but more that the gift of the Good News will be planted and the seed will grow to yield a great harvest in Kingdom lives, among the children and their families.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the work of grace here, and continue to pray for our Revitalization program. We recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We pray for us to grow towards spiritual maturity, using the means of discipleship, prayer and fellowship.

We uphold our students as they progress through this exam season. Bless them with clear minds and confident perseverance as they apply themselves to demonstrate their learning.

We pray also that You would restore those among us who are unwell or struggling in their circumstances, so that we may not be shaken as we trust in Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
