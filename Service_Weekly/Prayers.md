## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 1st June 2025

__Psalm 4:1 ESV__ 
_Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress._
_Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!_

### Thanks to God
O Lord, our righteousness! We thank You that we can call upon You when we are in distress, because we have the assurance that You hear us and You answer, according to Your Perfect will, and in Your perfect timing.

We thank You for Your great mercy and grace in sending Jesus to be the perfect sacrifice of the Lamb Who was slain for our sins. We thank You that we have been released from our bondage to sin, and that today we can celebrate the victory of the Cross and the Resurrection when we partake of the Lord’s Supper. Because Jesus fully obeyed, where we failed to obey and in fact rebelled against You gracious rule, You declared that our sin has been dealt with finally and fully, and the way back into Your holy presence is now open for all who believe.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We thank You Lord for the world in which we live, and marvel at the natural beauty we see around us, even as the seasons change according to Your plan and purpose. We still see evidence of Your handiwork and agree with Your Genesis declaration that “it was good.”

But we also see the effects of man’s sin, and long for the restoration promised when Jesus returns to take up His Kingship visibly. We pray, “Come quickly, Lord Jesus!”

As we wait with the sure hope of His return, we again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for Your church to stand firm upon the foundation of Your Word, declaring the Truth, not in judgement but in love for the lost. We yearn for Your Word to be held in high esteem, not for our comfort but for the sake of all those around us who are perplexed at the things they see happening, and who feel helpless as they drift through life without purpose.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We continue to pray for Alan as he progresses in his rehabilitation, and we thank You for the medical care we enjoy in this nation. We also pray for our study groups, as they learn from Your Word in our Hebrews series. Grant us clear minds to understand the meat of Your Word, and faithful hearts to live out the faith daily before a watching world. As we learn more of Jesus and His supremacy over all, we pray that we would grow to be more and more like Him in His grace and mercy, through the sanctifying presence of the Holy Spirit. 

We thank You for Douglas our Moderator bringing Your Word today, and leading us in the communion. We pray also for the Session, the Board, and the Selection Committee as they serve faithfully to fulfil Your purposes amongst us.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.
