## Prayers for our church and the world

## 12 Mar 2017 

__Psalm 55:22__ _Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Lord we thank You that we can come together and be in Your Presence with confidence, knowing that You have called each and every one of us. We thank You that we can cast our cares on You, the One Who sustains all things, the One Who gives us life, and the One Who redeems us, and Who sustains us constantly. We thank You that we can trust You completely. 

We thank You for Jesus, Who came to redeem us through the Cross, and Who also trusted Himself completely to You. You raised Him on the third day by the same power that originally created the world out of nothing, thus defeating death and releasing us from the fear of death as our enemy. 

We thank You Holy Spirit for Your constant Presence with us, working daily to bring our lives into alignment with the Perfect Life of Jesus, and making us fit for heaven. Some of that santifying process is painful and we find it hard to let go of the old ways, but we thank You that You never give up on us. We pray for the strength and the courage to overcome the old ways of sin and live in the newness of the resurrection life of Jesus Himself.

### The World & The Church
We thank You that our Christian life is not lived in isolation, but that You place us within Your Church the Body of Christ. We thank You that here we find fellowship and encouragement to persist in the ways of the Kingdom, to read Your Word, to pray and to extend Your love to others.

We pray for Your Church, Lord, seeing from our perspective much that disappoints and distresses us. We take comfort from Your Word that as You sustain us individually, You also sustain Your Church collectively. We pray that the faithful preaching of Your Word would bear much fruit both in the wider work around the world and here in Ashburton.

### Ashburton
We pray that You would continue to watch over us, and help us to be aligned with Your purposes for this area. We pray for the preparations and planning for next week's Family Fun Day, and for the distribution of leaflets during this week. 

Also, we pray again for our work with ESL students, many of whom have yet to return this year. We pray for those travelling to their home countries, that You would guard them and enable them to return to Australia when they have fulfilled their visa requirements. 

We thank You for everyone who comes each week, and we remember again those who can't be with us. We pray for Les Oliver during his recovery and restoration. We also lift up to You Jim Gleeson and Muriel French as they face chronic heart troubles. We thank You that they have close family to care for them daily, and we pray for effective medication and treatment for them. We pray also for Peter Jelliff as he requires additional surgery to restore his eyesight. We thank You for the remarkable advances in medicine and surgery and for the dedicated and skilled doctors here.

As we pray Lord, we remember that all good things come from Your gracious hands. Help us to be a thankful people, and to be ever ready to share the good news of Your saving grace with others, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles and read with me in today's second reading from Matthew chapter 25.
