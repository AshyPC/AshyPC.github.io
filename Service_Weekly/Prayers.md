## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 16th October 2022

__Ps 106:20-21__ 
_They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
(Psalm of repentance)_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, today we gather to praise You, Who saved Your chosen people in Egypt, and because You are our Saviour also. By sending Jesus to do Your Will, putting our penalty for sin upon Him, and granting us great mercy, in Your grace You have done great things for us. Through His death on the Cross and His resurrection, You have adopted us into Your family. We call Him our Elder Brother, yet He is our King of Kings, too.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we thank You that the Covid pandemic declaration has been lifted and the emergency measures no longer apply. We pray for wisdom to know how to be Godly citizens of our nation and our State of Victoria. We also pray that Your church would be alert at all times as a people who understand the times, and know Your purposes, whatever the circumstances we live in.

We thank You that we enjoy the privilege of voting for our representatives in Parliament. For the coming State election, we pray that the candidates and the parties would be truly representative, as servants of the people, but who also recognise that Your Law is their Higher Authority.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray for the Revitalization program as we work to see our church vision take shape, so that we can be a more effective channel for Your grace and mercy to reach this community. We want others to see and know for themselves that You are truly the God Who cares for His people, the only true Saviour and source of all hope.

We pray for those among us who need Your healing hand, especially remembering Diane and her heart condition, Margaret’s neuralgia and Shiun’s slow recovery. We pray also for safe travel and a refreshing time for Barry and Suzanne on leave. May they return with renewed zeal and energy to the work here that You have called them to.

We pray for Mook as he preaches today. May he expound clearly Your Word so that we grow in our understanding of Jesus, us as members of His body, the church, and our place in Your work here, Amen.

And now let us conclude this time of prayer with the prayer that Jesus taught His disciples:


Our Father, Who is in heaven,
hallowed be Your name;
Your kingdom come;
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.

For Yours is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
