## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 29th October 2017
__Jeremiah 42:6__ _Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the Lord our God...so that it may go well with us when we listen to the voice of the Lord our God._ (the weeping prophet)

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we give thanks today because You are the only and Sovereign God, All-Powerful, able to fulfill Your purposes despite what man does or fails to do. We thank You that You keep Your promises both in blessing and in curses, both in gracious mercy and in righteous justice. We know we need forgiveness just as did Your people in days past, and we know that we must confront the bad news abut ourselves in order to appreciate the Good News of Jesus.

### The World and the Church
We thank You for Your Church which You are building up daily. We thank You for saints who kept the faith in times past, as we remember this week both the Reformation and the season of All Saints. We give thanks that Luther was prepared to question the errors which had corrupted the church, wanting to see the Bride of Christ without spot or blemish. We remember and give thanks for others who translated the scriptures, who shared the Truth with as many as would listen, and who likewise sought to restore true worship in the church. We thank You for missionaries both famous and unknown who carried Your Word to different lands, and those who brought it to us so that we could hear and obey.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as servants in the work here. Heavenly Father, let us rejoice in your truth along with the Church Victorious, and help us to pray for the nations that you may be known. Fill us with your presence and power to testify of your great mercy and love to those who are lost. May we be today's Church Militant, holding firmly to the Truth with grace, without trying to compromise with the world. May we have the courage of a Jeremiah who at first brought the unpleasant word to his people, in order to prepare them for the pleasant word to come later - that their God had plans to give them a hope and a future.

We pray that this word would be for our community too, that Your mercy and love would be seen in us as we show the Holy Spirit's work in our lives more and more each day to those whom we meet and work with. In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now we come to the second reading of the Word from Romans.
