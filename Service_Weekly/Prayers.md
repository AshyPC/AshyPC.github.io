## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 22nd May 2022

__Gal 3:26-29__ 
_...for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we gather to give You thanks and praise today, as we prepare to witness Shon’s baptism. We praise You for the eternal provision of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us, so that we might have new life and a new eternal inheritance. We thank You for the fellowship of the saints and the spiritual bonds that keep us together, regardless of our ethnic background or our worldly nationality. We thank You that we are all Abraham’s offspring, heirs of the same eternal promise, made possible by the perfect work of Jesus in the Cross and the Resurrection.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we continue to pray about the war and refugee situation in the Ukraine, which does not look like being resolved anytime soon. While the big events fill our TVs and newspapers, we also give thanks for the quiet work of organisations such as Barnabas Aid, ministering without fanfare to ensure that people do not starve in northern Kenya. We also pray for the churches which have sprung up there to gather the scattered members of the body of Christ in drought-stricken areas, enabling fellowship and teaching so that believers are nurtured in their faith.

We also give thanks for Lazlo and Eva Mihalyi, working as missionaries in Hungary. We give thanks for their faithful, quiet service for the sake of the Kingdom. Their work may never be recognised in Birthday Honors lists but will be celebrated by the saints in heaven.

### Ashburton
__We thank You that today we will baptise Shon as a visible sign of his membership of the Body of Christ.__ 
We thank You that he has made a long journey to Australia, seeking a new life and finding his eternal life in Christ. We thank You that baptism is an outward sign of the inward change from a soul dead in sin to him now being a New Creation in Christ Jesus, with eternal assurance of salvation. We thank You that You have been leading him all that time, and we thank You that we have been instuments in Your hand to welcome him into the Kingdom. We continue to pray for resolution of his visa application, even while we recognise his higher citizenship in the heavenly realm where Jesus reigns at Your right hand.

We continue to pray for the elders, the Board and the leadership team working on our Revitalization program, as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community won into the Kingdom and serving Him in restored wholeness.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Shiun, and we pray for Diane as she continues to deal with persistent heart problems. Guide her doctors as they treat her with care and compassion.

We pray also for Mook and Talia, Jethro and Amy about to take some leave, and ask for thorough refreshing for them all. Grant them safety when they travel and keep their minds at peace as they trust in You every day.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. May Your Word be always fresh and alive to our hearing, knowing that we live within Your care, regardless of our external circumstances. And so we pray in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, Who reigns over all the affairs of man, Amen.
