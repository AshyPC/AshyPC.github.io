## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 3rd December 2022

__Jeremiah 9:24__ 
_I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the Lord._

### Thanks to God
As we come into summer and the Advent season, we gather as Your people in this place to praise You, Who sent our Lord Jesus to this earth to be our Saviour.

The One and Only Son of God was and is walking proof of Your steadfast love, justice and righteousness. Because You love us whom You made, but we turned away as the sin of Adam was passed down to us, He came to bear the just penalty for the sin of the world, to free us of an impossible burden, to grant us His righteousness. We stand before You now, guiltless only because of His Perfect sacrifice on our behalf. We pray that we may learn to delight in and practice these things which delight You, O Lord.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where so many turn their backs upon Jesus, so many try to defy You and dethrone You, and where others remain in darkness, never knowing that You are the only God, the One Who truly loves with the full knowledge of how utterly sinful they are, and we were.

We pray for Your Church, greatly distressed in so many places around the world where persecution robs believers of peace and safety. We pray for the Church in our country where it has been sidelined and ignored because people do not seek the Truth, and would rather practice self-righteousness, hatred and injustice. We pray for people to come and fill these seats to hear of the God Who loves them with an everlasting love, and Who wants to impart a sure hope of eternal life to all Whom You call.

### Ashburton
We thank You for Your work here in Ashburton, and pray for the Elders and Board of Management who met yesterday to plan ahead for next year. We know that we may plan and yet You overrule so that Your sovereign purposes are always fulfilled. But we seek to be purposeful, and work within the scope of purposes You have for us as a Body of Your peopole in this area. We continue to pray for the Revitalization program. Help us to take an active part in the process, so that we can be a more effective channel for Your grace and mercy to this community.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. May he expound it clearly so that we grow both in mind and spirit, in hearing and doing all that You call us to do. We pray for ourselves too, that we be active listeners and doers of Your Word so that we bring glory to the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
