## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 4th February 2018

__Psalms 20:7__ _Some boast in chariots and some in horses, But we will boast in the name of the Lord, our God._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we have come into Your House to praise and worship You, to hear Your Word read and preached, to commemorate Jesus' victory at the Cross. So many in the world boast of chariots and horses, and their own accomplishments we boast in the Name of our God. Because You are the Only God, the One Who made this world, Who sustains the entire creation, Who is altogether Righteous, Loving and forgiving. 

We thank You that Jesus, God the Son, came into our world to bring salvation to us, to reconcile us to You, for we were rebellious and refused to turn back to You. But You made the first step, You did the impossible to satisfy the requirements of true Justice in punishing sin, yet showed Yourself loving and merciful in saving us, who could not save ourselves.

We thank You, Holy Spirit for coming from heaven to testify to Jesus, to be with us daily, to change us to be like Jesus. We thank You for the unity You bring within the Body of Christ, and pray that we would grow more and more closely united as we fellowship together, serve one another and work together for the Kingdom. 

### The World & The Church
We see a world where people are perplexed, where they feel hopeless in the face of world events too big to understand, so they lose heart and wander about in their lives like sheep without a shepherd. 

We pray for Your church to declare Your Truth, to graciously recall people to the wisdom of old, to show compassion for the lost and to shepherd them as Your flock.

### Ashburton
May we as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, be a part of that great work to win souls, as ambassadors of Your salvation which is found only in Jesus. Help us to focus our attention and to work within Your purposes for the Ashburton, Chadstone, Holmesglen and Waverley areas, in Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Sandra will bring us the second reading from God's Word today.
