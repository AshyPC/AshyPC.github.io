## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 1st February 2026

**Psalms 65:5-7** 
_[5] By awesome deeds You answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, You who are the trust of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest sea;_
_[6] Who establishes the mountains by His strength, Being girded with might;_
_[7] Who stills the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we worship You today as the awesome God of Creation. We also worship You as the God of Righteousness, Who saved us not because of anything we had done, but because of Your love and mercy expressed towards us who rebelled and fell under the power of the enemy.

We thank You for Jesus, Your Only Son, the Living Word, Who came on a rescue mission to save us by defeating the enemy. We thank You that, through the horrors of apparent defeat in the Cross, we have been set free from sin. We thank You that when Jesus rose from the grave in victory, He gave us new life, and unmerited righteousness in exchange for our sinful past.

We thank You that we will shortly take part in the Lord’s Supper, commemorating the Cross and Resurrection, which gave us a sure hope for our eternal future in restored relationship with You.

We thank You for the written Word also, preserved through time, guarded and proclaimed by Your church worldwide. We seek to treasure it because we find it to be Your trustworthy communication with us, revealing to us all that we need for life and godliness.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for the Church in this world, as the guardian of the Truth of Your Word, to proclaim Your life-giving Word of salvation, but also Your warning of judgement to a world which still wants to turn away from You. We thank You for the many places where Your Word of Truth is being declared today, and pray for continued boldness in this time when so many do not want to hear.

**Ashburton**
We pray for our work here at Ashburton, as we labour with our various talents and abilities in the work of the Kingdom. We pray for the man of Your choosing to lead this work, and we pray for the Selection Committee, as they seek Your wisdom, and work to do Your will, so that in the end, Your purposes prevail. We pray for ourselves to support them in their work, as they serve on our behalf in what could be a lengthy process.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane, Russell and Jocelyn, John McKenzie with his ongoing treatment and others affected by illness or injury. 

We pray for our fellowship one with another, supporting and encouraging each other towards greater godliness. We pray for Douglas as he preaches today. May his words build us up so that we show forth the grace of our Lord to all whom we meet.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
