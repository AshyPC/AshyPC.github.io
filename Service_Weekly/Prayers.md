## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 95:6-7__ _Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker; for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are our Maker, and that we are still under Your care despite turning away from You.

You are still God Almighty, King of the Universe but we have tried to build our own thrones and be rulers of our own lives.

We thank You that You did not abandon us but sent Jesus to redeem us from our wilfulness.

We thank You that all those whom You have called are counted as Your people, and graciously accepted into the family of God, with a sure hope of a home in heaven.

We thank You that the Holy Spirit is drawing us away from self-centredness to become God-centred, to give You Your rightful place in our lives.

### The World & The Church
But as we give thanks, we see a world where many still do not know You, still refuse to acknowledge their Maker and King, and so we pray that we might be effective ambassadors of the Kingdom of Heaven, sharing Good News, speaking the truth of the God Who cares, and Who wants to bring many sons and daughters to glory. 

Last week our nation paused to remember and to give thanks for those who sacrificed their lives to save our land and preserve our future here. We pray that many more will lift their eyes to see that Jesus sacrifice was so much greater, and that it is of eternal significance. 

For our church, Lord we also want to pray, as our Commission of Assembly meets this week to deliberate over matters great and small. We pray for wisdom as they deal with many topics, and we pray that they may at all times be aware of how these things work towards the fulfillment of Your Kingdom purposes.  

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, Lord, we thank You for calling us to be a part of Your kingdom work for the people of this area. We pray for the work we are about to do as part of "Hope For Booroondara." We seek not only to help meet the needs of those in distress, but also to demonstrate the loving character of our Lord and Saviour. We pray for opportunities to share the Good News of new life in Jesus with the people we meet.

We acknowledge, Lord, that whatever we do needs to be in accordance with Your plan and purposes, knowing that You go before us to prepare the hearts of those we meet. We thank You that we do not venture out alone, but go with the Holy Spirit. May we therefore do all these things to further the Kingdoom and for Your glory alone. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles as MarJo comes to bring us today's second reading from second Samuel.
