## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 19th May 2019
__Psalm 50:14-15__ _Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving And pay your vows to the Most High;  Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I shall rescue you, and you will honor Me._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we gather today by appointment to meet with You, to offer our praises and give thanks for all that You have blessed us with. We rememberi that Jesus laid down His life for us, who were Your enemies but who have now become members of the family of heaven by Your sovereign grace.

We thank You for the freedoms and the peace we enjoy and pray that we would understand how precious is the gift that You have given. Whether we are facing trouble, as David was when writing this psalm, or not, may we not take You for granted but always seek to love and serve You with all our hearts. To that end, we ask that You would remove our old hearts of stone and grant us hearts of flesh, tuned to respond to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. 

### The World and the Church
Yesterday we exercised our privilege to vote for representatives to sit in Federal Parliament. Whilst some results are  not yet clear, we pray for all those elected to serve this nation, that we may remain free to uphold and proclaim the Truths of Your Word both here in this place, and everywhere we go throughout the week.

We pray that Your Church would be bold to proclaim that Truth in word and deed. May we demonstrate it in our lives together so that the world may see and understand that Jesus is the One promised, and sent by You to be the Saviour of the world. 

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We thank You for the bountiful, generous responses to the Food Drive which we saw yesterday, and we pray for the collection teams as they go out this afternoon. May all that has been collected be put to good use in serving those in this community who are in need.

We pray for the Board of Management, that there will be sufficient people to serve the needs of the congregation in wise stewardship of all that You have placed into our care. May we always use everything that You give to serve the Kingdom purposes for which You have called us together here.

As we work together, we pray for continued unity of fellowship, so that we may demonstrate Your love and the fact that You sent Jesus into this world as the One and Only Saviour, our Redeemer.

In His Great Name we pray, Amen.

And now Kum Seng will bring our second reading for today.
