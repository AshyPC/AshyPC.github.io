## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 29th September 2024

__Psalm 112:6-7__ 
    _For the righteous will never be moved; he will be remembered forever._
    _He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the Lord._

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we come before You, giving thanks that our salvation rests not on ourselves, but on Jesus Christ the Righteous One. We do not need to fear bad news because we can trust in You always.

We confess Lord, that our sinful pride was what made salvation necessary. We thank You for Jesus Who went to the Cross to take away our sin. We thank You that He took the judgment that we deserved, He paid the penalty that we could not pay, and rose again to give is His righteousness, His endless life, so that we may no longer be defeated by sin but may grow in grace, as we become more like Him, day by day.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
We pray for this hurting world where we still see hatred, anger and warfare. We pray that the Prince of Peace would bring the peace we long for. But in the meantime, we pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the nation of Israel, as it fights to preserve its own freedom and oppose tyranny and terrorism.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our leaders, our governing authorities to work for the good of nation. We pray especially for law and order in our communities, for our Police and emergency services people who face dangers we barely know about. Guard and protect them, Lord, as they work to protect us, and enable them to Uphold the Right.

This month we have been supporting the work of Operation Christimas Child. We thank You for Samaritanâ€™s Purse ministries as they distribute shoeboxes as gifts and speak of Your gift of Jesus as Saviour of the world.

__Ashburton__
We pray for ourselves as we seek to grow in Godliness and submit to Your Word, knowing that we are yet imperfect and prone to forget the great salvation You have provided in Jesus. We pray for our public witness through the Carols service in December. Help us to plan activities to demonstrate Your love working through us towards the visitors who come.

We thank You Lord for Mook, who has taken on so much extra this year. We pray that You would strengthen him, and protect him and Talia, Jethro, Amy and Judah, as they take a break. Grant them all rest and refreshing, and uplift them in their spirits.

We thank You for Douglas Milne, our Moderator, as he plans for preachers to contrinue the faithful proclamation of Your Word here. We pray that today and every day we would be diligent in study but also in doing what Your Word declares.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.
