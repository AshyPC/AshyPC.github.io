## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 27th Oct 2019 

__Jeremiah 17:7-8__ _Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and whose trust is the Lord. For he will be like a tree planted by the water, that extends its roots by a stream and will not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought, nor cease to yield fruit._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we come before You today, acknowledging Your sovereignty and our dependence upon You. Like Jeremiah, we see this nation, of which we are a part, forsaking Your righteousness and abandoning the Word of Truth.  This has been happening progressively for a long time, and we thank You for Your mercy and grace so that we are not consumed in judgement. We thank You for our own situation as sinners saved by Your grace, because Jesus took our place, suffered and died for our sins, and rose on the third day. 

### The World and the Church
However, we confess the sins of our nation and our State where life is considered cheap, both for the unborn and for the elderly. We confess that we are a nation wanting to go its own way, a nation which has turned its back on You, and substituted false religions for the true faith delivered once for all to the saints. We see the drought as one of the consequences of rejecting the wisdom from above, and instead adopting the so-called wisdom of the present times.

We plead for our land to be restored from its drought for the only Word which can save us from spiritual darkness. We pray for Your Church to be strong in the face of opposition and pressure to compromise with that Word. We pray that the clouds of spiritual confusion and comkpromise over our governments would be dispelled by the work of the Spirit. 

We pray for the many churches which have been invaded by worldly attitudes and compromise. We pray that they may be turned around so that Your church would again be known as the Pillar of Truth in this community and this nation.

### Ashburton
For the work You are doing here in Ashburton, we pray for Barry and Suzanne on leave - may they be refreshed and rested during their time away. We thank You, Lord that here we enjoy the blessings of faithful Godly preaching. We continue to pray for Your protection and guidance for Barry and Mook, and we thank You for Dr Milne expounding Your Word today. 

We pray for ourselves to be faithful and true to Your Word also, to have attentive ears, a ready heart to receive and a willingness to act in accordance with the truth. May we be ever growing in Godliness so that we are known as people of integrity, without fault at home, at work, in studies and in our communities. We pray also that our unity in the Spirit would be enhanced and strengthened as we serve one another and the community around us, striving to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Gaye McKenzie will bring our second reading for today.
