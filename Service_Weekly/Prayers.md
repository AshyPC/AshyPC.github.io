## Prayers for our unity in the work of the Kingdom 
### 2nd July 2017

__Eph 2:13-14__ _ But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 
For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility_

UNITY

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
Lord Almighty, we have gathered today to worship You as Father, Son and Holy Spirit - the unity of Three In One.

You initially created a world and mankind to reflect that same unity in all things. But because of sin there came division and separation, and man turned his back on You. But today we also celebrate the Lord's Supper, remembering what Jesus did on the Cross to bring peace again between God and man, and between man and his neighbour. Even in this we see the united work of the Godhead - Father, Son and Holy Spirit working together to bring salvation to mankind, and to spread the Good News to all the world. 

### Ashburton
We thank You that today we see another aspect of that unity in the Church here as we join Ashburton and South Camberwell congregations into one, so that the work of the Kingdom can be extended. We thank You that Jesus has made us into one. We thank You that as we have met together, we have sensed the unity that comes from the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, so that we all seek to serve Jesus as King of Kings and Lord of His Church.

We thank you that you have broken down every dividing wall of prejudice and hostility. As we continue to work and worship together, we pray that You would lead us, so that we do not focus on our differences in social or ethnic backgrounds to make artificial distinctions.

Help us to live in peace and build friendly relationships with all irrespective of their backgrounds. Strengthen our resolve to work in unity, to demonstrate that Jesus is our peace, to achieve Your purposes and extend Your kingdom.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Gaye to bring today's reading from second Samuel chapter 9.
