## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 26th November 2017
__1 Cor 16:9__ _a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me_ 
Paul, writing of his work in Ephesus  

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come before You to acknowlwdge that You are sovereign over all this world, and the Author and Sustainer of all life. We thank You for Jesus Who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, our Redeemer. We thank You that He laid down His life for every believer in the Body of Christ, and only by His death and resurrection can we be saved.

### The World and the Church
We thank You that You are sovereign over this nation and this State, which have each just voted for changes which are so contrary to Your Word in the areas of Life and Marriage that we find it hard to understand. 

Therefore we pray that we might see the present circumstances with the eyes of the Apostle Paul, and look for the door of opportunity to be open, so that we may share the Good News of Your great grace. 

We pray for Your Church to be built up daily. We pray that Your people would realise that there has always been opposition to the Good News, for there is a defeated enemy who doesn't want to give up, and there are rebellious people who want to run their own lives rather than submit to You.  

Thank You for faithful saints of the past, who persevered in the face of the opposing forces of their day and delivered to succeeding generations the Word and the Faith. We pray that we would be equally faithful to deliver the same Faith to the coming generations.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We give thanks for the safe return of Tat & Julie, and pray for others still travelling. We thank You for the blessings of safe and fast travel and for the amzing communications we employ to keep in touch with family and friends. 

We give thanks for the Ashwood Family Day, and for the people who came. We pray that we may be able to follow up on the contacts made, that the seeds of the gospel might be sown in good soil. 
We also pray for those in our midst who are in need of Your particular love and care. May we be instruments of mercy to our fellow believers. We expecially remember Muriel, and Jim & Diane, Ruth and Ken.

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will ask Theodore to bring our second reading of the Word, from Romans.
