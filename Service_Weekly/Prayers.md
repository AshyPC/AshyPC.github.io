## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 1st March 2026

**Lamentations 3:40-41**
_[40] Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the Lord!_
_[41] Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven_

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You are always ready to receive us when we return to You.

We know that we have failed in many ways this week past, but we turn back to You in repentance, trusting in Your mercy and grace as expressed in Jesus Who came to fulfill all righteousness on our behalf.

We thank You that we will shortly take part in the Lord’s Supper, commemorating the Cross and Resurrection, which secured our eternal salvation. We thank You that Jesus has given us His perfect righteousness, in place of our self-righteousness, His riches for our poverty, and that we will one day join Him in His heavenly home, as He once joined us on this Earth.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to be with us daily, to come alongside and enable us to resist temptation, to open our minds to Your Word, and to grant us wisdom as we live in this fallen world.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
We pray for this world which has once again become more dangerous and where we again see warfare reported vividly on our TV screens. We recall from Your Word that Jesus warned of wars and rumours of wars, but we are reassured that this is not the end, and You always hold this world in Your hands, despite what man may do to kill and destroy.

We pray for believers in those war-torn trouble spots, for their safety, their encouragement, and for help to flee the danger. We pray for Your church to stand firm, for the good news to overcome the bad, and for souls to be saved even in these troubled days.

**Ashburton**
We continue to pray for our work here at Ashburton, even though we could not hold our usual evening prayer service last week. We pray that You would continue to lead us, draw us closer to the Cross, and enable us to do You will here, so that we witness faithfully to Your saving work in this community.

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand. And we give thanks for Your Word, and for Douglas as he preaches today, and then leads in the Lord’s Supper. We pray that we would recognise afresh the Body of Christ and grasp more fully the greatness of Your grace, as we celebrate spiritually the impact of the Resurrection upon us as Your redeemed people.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.
