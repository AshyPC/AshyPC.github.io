## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 14th Jul 2019
__Micah 7:18__ _Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in unchanging love._

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we come into Your Presence today acknowledging Your great mercy and grace toward us, Your people. Because we have inherited Adam's nature, we know we have sinned in thought word and deed. 

And then, at just the right time, Jesus came to this Earth, shared our humanity but without inheriting Adam's sin. He remained sinless, and because of our sin He went to the Cross to take the just penalty on our behalf. 

We thank You that this was part of the plan of redemption, and Micah spoke of it centuries before Jesus came. We thank You that You are forever the God of unchanging love, and we pray that we would know that in increasing measure each day.

### The World and the Church
We pray for this world which does not know the God of Love but only the God of Judgement. So many seek justice for the many wrongs they see, relationships of love towards themselves, grace and mercy for their own failings. And yet, so many do not see that they cannot give these things to others unless they first receive them from You. We pray for them to have their eyes opened to truly see that You have made the way open for them to receive Your pardon, through Jesus death and resurrection.  

We pray for Your Church to be strong in the face of opposition and persecution. We pray for believers in Mali and other parts of West Africa who are being killed and injured by extremists simply for being Christians. We pray also for the Church in Australia to be firm and recognise opposition when it shows. Help us all to be faithful witnesses, whatever may come our way. We give thanks for a Prime Minister who is not afraid to declare his faith in public and we continue to pray for good and righteous government at all levels, for integrity among our Parliamentary and local council representatives.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We thank You for the faithful preaching we receive from Barry and Mook, and pray that You would continue to protect them and their families as they serve You and us in preaching and teaching. We pray also for ourselves to be alert hearers and diligent doers of Your Word, so that we may not be found lacking by those around us should they question our faith.  

We pray for our fellowship one with another and thank You for the safe return of John & Gaye McKenzie and Sandra and Newton Mattison. We continue to pray for Sandra's brother James with inoperable cancer and we pray for the whole family that they may face the difficulty of his condition in Your strength and the knowledge that they are not on their own.

As we work together, we pray again for continued progress with the building project, so that all we do with what You give us is dedicated to the purposes of winning people into the Kingdom of the One and Only Saviour, our Redeemer, In Whose Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now Rachel is coming to bring our second reading for today.
