## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 14th January 2018

__Psalm 9:7,9__ _But the Lord abides forever;...The Lord [] will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble;_

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we have come together to bring You praise and worship, to hear Your Word read and preached, and to encourage each other in fellowship. We are here not by chance, but by royal appointment.
Because You are God from everlasting to everlasting, we can put our trust in You. 

We thank You that Jesus, God the Son, Second Person of the Trinity, came into our world in order to bring salvation to us, for we could not save ourselves. We thank You that He conquered death for us, so that it no longer holds us in fear of what the future may hold. 

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit to be our constant Teacher, Guide and Sanctifier as we daily progress under His direction towards the goal of being like Jesus. We thank You that He aligns our lives daily with Your purposes in accordance with the New Life You have given us. We know that we are not yet perfect, but we strive towards that goal as we make use of the means of grace which You have provided.

### The World & The Church
As we look about us Lord, we see storm clouds of life brewing and we pray for our world and our nation. We thank You for those places where the Gospel is making great gains, and we wonder at the hardness we see within our own country. 

We pray for Your church to rise up and be strong in the strength that You give to declare Your might, to recall people to the banner of the Truth, to show compassion for the lost and to defend the defenceless, so that they may know for sure that the Lord is their only stronghold.

### Ashburton
Within our own congregation we pray today especially for the family and friends of Jim Gleeson and Betty Oliver, both of whom are now at rest with You. We thank You that being in Your Presence is far better, but we also know we are here in this world to serve. Thank You that all our days are numbered by You, and that Betty and Jim have concluded their time here in accordance with Your plan and purpose for them. 

In Jesus Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will ask you to stand as we sing our next hymn "A Mighty Fortress is Our God".
