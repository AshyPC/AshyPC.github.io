## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 19th November 2023

__Micah 7:7-8__ 
_But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation;_
	_my God will hear me._
_Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall rise;_
	_when I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light to me._

### Thanks to God
Sovereign God, we thank You that You hear us, not because of our righteousness, for we have none. Only because of Your grace and mercy, because Jesus came to live the Perfect Life which we could not, took the penalty which we could not pay, and gave us His spotless righteousness in exchange for our sin.

We thank You that because of this great and gracious exchange, we can walk free of the guilt of our sin, and in reliance upon the Holy Spirit within, we can resist or avoid temptations when they come.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We thank You that Your servant Micah, guided by Your Holy Spirit, spoke of the sinfulness of mankind, using words which describe our world in this present time. Whether the siutation is of war in the Middle East or of “natural” disasters in Nepal, whether it is overbearing governments or the willing sinfulness of greedy men, we pray for a restoration, a revival of Godliness. We wait upon You, for nothing takes You by surprise, You see and know all, and You continue to work out Your purposes for this world which You created to manifest Your glory.

Whatever we go through, we trust that You alone enable us to rise from a fall, and You alone supply us with the Light of Your Word to defeat the darkness around us.

We pray for Your Church, the Body of Christ, to continue to proclaim the Truth as You have declared it it in Your Word. We pray for all who preach Your Word that they would do it faithfully, upholding Your Word despite every public effort we see trying to change the truth into falsehood.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the work of grace here, and continue to pray for our Revitalization program. We recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We pray for us to grow towards spiritual maturity, using the means of discipleship, prayer and fellowship.

We uphold our students as they progress through this exam season. Bless them with clear minds and confident perseverance as they apply themselves to demonstrate their learning.

We pray also that You would restore those among us who are unwell or struggling in their circumstances, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, the God of our salvation,  Amen.
