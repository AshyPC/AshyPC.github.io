## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 119:34__ _Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that have created a world which was once perfect, but even now, groaning under the curse, it remains orderly and we thank You that You have made us to fit into this world and understand it. With the Psalmist we pray for understanding, so that we can honour You as Creator, but especially to honour You as the Giver of the perfect law, the only One worthy of our wholehearted obedience.

We thank You for Your mercy, in the face of Adam and Eve's rebellion, and in our deliberately following in their ways. We deserved only Your justice, but because Jesus went to the Cross on our behalf, and then rose from the dead to secure our salvation and grant us the inheritance which was properly His, we are released from the power, the penalty and the guilt of sin. 

### The World & The Church
We are saddened as we see a world still in rebellion against Your law and Your creation, as evidenced by the attacks on Margaret Court this week. We pray for her and for others who make a public stand for the truth of Your Word. We pray that the anger of her opponents will be seen by more and more people for what it really is, and that they will turn away from those activists who malign Your people.

Help us to truly understand Your Word, so that we may recognise the Truth and challenge error, regardless of who says it. We pray that the Body of Christ would be able to support prominent people when they make a stand. May it be the Church militant instead of the Church dormant.

### Ashburton
Today we gather around Your table to celebrate the Lord's Supper. We thank You for Your provision of both Word and Sacraments for building up the Body. Holy Spirit we ask You to strengthen us, enable us to take in all that You provide for us via these means of grace. 

Help us also to remember that we are a body of people together, and not merely a collection of individuals. We want to pray for each other, encourage one another and build each other up in this most holy faith. We continue to uphold those in need of Your healing hand: Jim, Muriel, Ruth, and Eric. 

Finally we ask that You help us keep the goal of Heaven in view, always aiming to further the Kingdom and see Jesus glorified. For it is in His precious Name that we pray, Amen.

And now I will hand over to Mook for today's reading from second Samuel chapter 5.
