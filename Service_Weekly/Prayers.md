## Prayers for our church and the world

__Psalm 106:47__ _Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are our God, because You have a clear purpose - to see peoples of every nation praising Your Name. You have redeemed us from our former life, rescued us from a self-centred and futile existence so that we can join with You in seeing people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation gathered around the Heavenly throne. 

### The World & The Church
We thank You for gathering us into the Kingdom of Your Son, making us a part of the Body of Christ - Your church, the new Jerusalem, the army of God winning more and more people into this Kingdom. 

Again this week we saw the destructive force of terrorism strike, not once, but twice. We pray that Your church would use different weapons - grace and compassion, prayer and the Word as we seek out those Whom You have marked for salvation. 

We pray for Your protection over missionaries serving in high-risk locations. Some we can' t even name fully, but we know that You know exactly who they are. Lord we see that danger is not limited to certain places, but we pray especially for them to know the shelter of the Almighty, the Maker of heaven and earth.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, Lord, we ask again that You would grant us a greater fervour to find the lost so that they can join us in praise for the Lamb of God from every tribe and nation. We pray that these seats be filled with new believers so that this building may resound with Your praise!

We thank You that You have drawn us from different backgrounds, and You are building us into a united body working to see Your purposes fulfilled in this place. We thank You for ESL students drawn from many nations, and we thank You that You enable us to serve them and show Your care and concern to them as individuals.

We continue to uphold those in need of Your healing hand: Jim, Muriel, Ruth.
Finally, Lord, we thank You for the leading of the Holy Spirit in our daily lives. We pray that as we read Your Word, as we speak to others, as we serve in practical ways, we would be in step with His leading - neither running ahead nor lagging behind. Keep us clear and firm, with the goal of Heaven in view, always aiming to further the Kingdom and see Jesus glorified. For it is in His precious Name that we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Sandra to bring us today's reading from second Samuel.
