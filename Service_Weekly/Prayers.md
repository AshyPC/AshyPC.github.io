## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 10th July 2022

__Psalm 103:1-3__ 
_Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits,
Who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases_

Let us pause for a moment to remember some of Godâ€™s blessing to us over this past week.

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we give You thanks and praise today, remembering the many benefitrs You have blessed us with. We praise You for the forgiveness of our sin, made possible only because the Lord Jesus Christ gave Himself for us, so that we might have new life and a new eternal inheritance. We thank You for the work of the Holy Spirit Who has taken up residence within, so that we may be progressively sanctified, made ready to live in eternity in Your Presence.

We thank You for the blessings of health which we enjoy because You have made our bodies to repair themselves daily. We thank You for the blessings of emergency services, hospitals, specialists, doctors and nurses, for their training and experience, and for their dedicated service to those of us in need.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world we continue to pray about the war and refugee situation in the Ukraine. We also give thanks for the work of churches in neighbouring countries, where so many are working to care for the refugees pouring across the borders. We remember Lazlo & Eva Mihalyi, and pray that the missionary support funds raised will reach them quickly and enable them to work more effectively than ever.

We pray for the Mathys family returning to PNG via Brisbane next week. We pray for their preparations and packing to be thorough, and for them to re-acclimatise to tropical weather and their various responsibilities in Ukarumpa.

### Ashburton
We again pray for the elders, the Board and the leadership team working on our Revitalization program, as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community won into the Kingdom and serving Him in restored wholeness. We pray also for Rod Morris as he consults with us, bringing his outside perspective on our work here.

We pray also for the Church Camp coming up in just a few weeks. May it be a time of rich blessing as we learn more from Your Word and draw closer together, so that the work of the gospel may advance more effectively her. We pray for Peter Sorenson as he prepares to lead the teaching program.

We thank You again for the blessings of high-level health care we enjoy in this country, as we continue to pray in particular for Shiun and for Diane as she continues to deal with persistent health problems. Guide her doctors as they prepare her for an operation in the coming weeks.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches today. Help us to take Your Word deep into our hearts and make it a part of our lives every day. May what we learn today have both a spiritual and a practical impact upon those with whom You lead us to in the coming week. And so we pray in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, for Whose Kingdom we work as You enable us, Amen.
