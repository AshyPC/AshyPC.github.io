## Prayers for our World and the Church 
## including Prayer of Confession
### 23rd March 2025

__Micah 7:18-20__ 
_[18]  Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity and passing over transgression for the remnant of his inheritance? He does not retain his anger forever because he delights in steadfast love._
_[19] He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities underfoot. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea._
_[20]  You will show faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham, as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old._

### Adoration
Father God, we, Your children by adoption, dare to come before You only because of Your compassion and great mercy, pardoning our iniquity and bringing us into Your heavenly family. You are God Almighty, showing faithfulness to Your chosen people, and unmerited favour to us who were outside the commonwealth of Israel. We thank You that we have been grafted into the vine, so that we draw new life from Jesus.

### Confession
We look back upon our week and recognise the times when we have failed, when we have forgotten Your great grace, or failed to trust Your goodness, or wandered away from the way in which we should walk. We are ashamed of our thoughts, words and deeds and freely confess them to You now. But because You are all-loving, and graciously merciful, we trust that You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea, so that we do not go down to the pit, but instead we lift up our souls to You.

### Thanksgiving
We thank You that You have not abandoned us, but rescued us because of Your steadfast love. We thank You for the special grace of salvation: while we were still sinners, Jesus came to take our place, dying in our stead so we could go free.

We thank You that You raised Him up and He is now seated in glory, and we thank You that there will be a final end to sin when Jesus returns to establish the new heavens and the new earth. We look forward to that sure hope which is guaranteed to us by the resurrection, and ministered to us by the Holy Spirit.

### Supplication: The Wider World
In the wider world, we continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, for the nation and the people of Israel. We pray for less war in many places, including the Ukraine. We also pray for the persecuted church suffering around the world. We ask for comfort and courage as the people are subject to so much opposition, just for seeking to worship Jesus.

We remember those who have been flooded in Queensland and NSW, even though we donâ€™t hear much news as they deal with the aftermath of Cyclone Alfred. We pray for perseverance and strength during their long recovery time.

We pray also for the coming Federal election, whenever it will be held, that we would see Godly men and women elected and that their work would lead to a restoration of Godliness and integrity in public office. We pray for a healing of the many divisions apparent within our nation.

### ... and the wider Church
We give thanks for Your people in churches where Your Word is faithfully preached. We pray also for those places where there is a drought of Your Word. We thank You for our Colleges training men to preach, and pray You would call more men to take up this high calling.

### Supplication: Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we pray for those in need of Your healing touch. We remember Alan as he continues his rehabilitation, and Jan as she cares for him.

We pray for Brett as he preaches Your Word today, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. Holy Spirit, we pray that You would change us so that we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word, knowing the assurance we have in the finished work of the Cross.

Finally, we pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We thank You that we are a part of the work of spreading the Good News. May we grow to show the character of our Risen Lord so well that others will see Him rather than us.

In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
