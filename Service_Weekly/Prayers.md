## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 12th January 2020 

__Psalms 8:3-5__ _When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained; What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown him with glory and majesty!_

### Thanks to God
Father God, we come before Youtoday in worship and praise. We declare that You are worthy of all our praise but we also admit that we are weak and feeble in what we bring to You.

When we see in Your Word how You have made us just a little lower than Yourself, and still crown us with glory and honour, we are in awe at Your great grace shown to us. You call us to be holy as You are holy, but because of Adam's sin we cannot do that of ourselves. We thank You that You sent Jesus to become one of us, to bridge the great chasm, to do the impossible, and restore all that was lost in the Fall.We thank You that despite our sinful natures, He has restored us to Your Presence and He is the One now crowned with Glory and Honour.

### The World and the Church
We thank You for the relief that the rain has brought to Victoria and pray again for relief for the fire zones and drought-affected areas in other States. As the fires subside, we pray that we would not revert to our old sinful ways once the crisis passes. We remain in prayer for the spiritual condition of our State and nation. 

Whilst the main focus of newshas been the fires, we pray for other areas of the Church's work. We thank You for the many ways in which the Body of Christ works out the Great Commission both in the Word by preaching and teaching, and in Deed by the various services of schools, hospitals, chaplaincy, aged care. We pray that the Church would continue to minister to the needs of all as it serves obediently its Lord and Master, Jesus.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves in this field of work where You have placed us. Strengthen and encourage us to be faithful and true to Your Word also, and as we serve this community and the many people we come into contact with in our daily walk, striving to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.

And now I will hand over to John Lee who will bring our next reading from God's Word.
