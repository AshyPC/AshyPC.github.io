## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 5th September 2021 (Father's Day)

__Lamentations 1:1__ _How lonely sits the city that was full of people! She has become like a widow who was once great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer!_

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we thank You that You are our faithful God, the One Who sees all, knows all and holds the future in Your hands. We meet again under lockdown conditions and lament the emptiness of our church buildings, which were meant to be full of Your people, singing Your praises.

We thank You for the modern means we have available to keep in touch and to participate in different ways in worship on this Lord’s Day.

We know that we live in a fallen, broken world where bad news is obvious. Yet we thank You that You sent Jesus to pay the penalty for sin, to remove our guilt, and to give us the free gift of life through His death and resurrection. We thank You for His promise to never leave us and we thank You for sending the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us, so that we can grow more like Jesus every day.

### The Wide World 
We continue to pray for the situation in Afghanistan, where believers who have converted from Islam are in grave danger from the resurgence of terrorism there. We pray for them and for the aid workers operating in secret now that there is no military protection, as they  struggle to bring what help they can.

We also pray for the persecuted believers in Myanmar, where ethnic and Christian minority groups the Karen, Kachin and Chin peoples are attacked regularly by the military regime and are forced to go into hiding. They also suffer from the Covid pandemic but are denied any medical assistance.

### ... and in the wider Church
We pray for Your Church as lockdowns are extended further, both here in Victoria and interstate. We pray that the full range of medical treatments would be applied to provide for maximum relief, and pray that Your Church would remain strong in the face of passive persecution which keeps us in hiding almost as much as believers in other places. We pray that our governments would stop trying to control or eliminate the virus, because they seek to displace You in Your sovereignty.

We pray that the work of Your church might continue despite the restrictions, and that Your people may be ready to shine with the hope we have in You. We ask that You would enable us to strengthen our bonds of fellowship and demonstrate Your love and care for Your people in the way that we relate to one another.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we thank You that You sustain us day by day. As we do so, we thank You for the progress made by Margaret and Barbara. We pray for Diane as she continues to recover under her doctor’s supervision and care. We pray also for Shiun whose has had a setback in his reccovery from stroke and we uphold Aahs’s mum in India, who is now recovering. We pray for her continued progress and thank You for her family’s support and encouragement.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word in our new series on Peter’s letters to the persecuted church of his time, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. Help us to see how it relates to our own situation and what we need to do to bring our lives into fully conformity with Your law and Your ways.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray all these things, Amen.
