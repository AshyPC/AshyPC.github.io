__1 Peter 1:24-25__ 
    _“All people are like grass,_
    _and all their glory is like the flowers of the field;_
    _the grass withers and the flowers fall,_
    _but the word of the Lord endures forever.”_

#Thanks to God#
O Lord, we gather today, encouraged by the words of Isaiah, which Peter brings to our attention. We recognise that we are limited but You are infinite. We thank You that Your Word endures forever, because You are eternal. We thank You that we are born again of imperishable seed, and that You are making us anew, fully in the image of Jesus, with His righteousness, trusting in Your promise that You persevere with us despite our weaknesses.

We thank You for Jesus Who lives and reigns in heaven with You, and Who intercedes for us before Your throne of grace.

We thank You for the promised Holy Spirit, Who remains with us as the Eternal Comforter and Guide into all truth.

#The Wide World... and the Wider Church#
Lord, we look at our broken world with people looking in all the wrong places for what they need, which is forgiveness from You, granted by Your grace through the finished work of Jesus on the Cross. We thank You, as we approach Easter time, for the fact that Jesus died to pay t he penalty for our sins and rose to grant us new life. We thank You that Life is greater than Death, and Your love is greater than our sin.

We thank You for Your people who go where we can’t reach – and we pray today especially for Samuel and Dhruti Christian working in tense situations in India. We pray for the government to ensure freedom of religion, for believers to be protected from persecution and to protect the Christians as they work. Grant them wisdom as they plan and direct their work. 

We thank You for the Good News of salvation in Jesus, for Your enduring Word which informs our minds and hearts, and for Your Church which has upheld the truth delivered once for all to the saints throughout history.

#Ashburton#
We pray for ourselves as we continue to deal with our changed situation here. We thank You for the strength of the bonds of fellowship, and pray for our continued support and encouragement, one with another. We remember those among us who are unwell or struggling, and pray that You would restore them and sustain them, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
