## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 11th April 2021

__Ps 94:14‭-‬15__ _For the Lord will not abandon His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance.
For judgement will again be righteous, And all the upright in heart will follow it._

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You remain ever-faithful to Your covenant and You do not abandon Your people, despite their weakness and outright rebelliousness. We thank You that You have made us into Your people in this place and at this time.

We thank You that You sent Jesus on a unique mission – to win back Your people from the hands of the enemy. We thank You that He remained faithful to that mission, to endure the Cross on our behalf, and so become the Perfect sacrifice which we needed in order to be rescued from our sin.

We thank You that You raised Him up on the third day, fulfilling Your promise to provide a Redeemer and Champion greater than King David, so much greater that He broke down the wall of hostility between the Jewish nation and the rest of the world. As a result, we who were once not a people could become sons and daughters of the living God.

### The Wider World
Lord, You express in Your Word special concern for widows and orphans, and today we pray for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, already orphaned and now widowed by the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. May Her Majesty’s faith in You remain strong during this time of loss and grieving. We give thanks that some of Prince Philip’s wartime service was spent in the Pacific theatre, defending Australia.

### ... and the wider Church
We pray also for Your people in Myanmar, where Karen believers have been forced to hide in the jungle for safety. We pray for the work of Barnabas Fund as they continue to bring life-sustaining relief wherever they can reach.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we pray for Margaret and Barbara as they make progress in overcoming their health problems. We pray for wisdom and insight for their doctors so that they can employ the most effective treatments available.

We pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We pray for the Session as they seek to understand Your vision for our congregation, so that we may serve in unity, with clarity and focus as we witness to Your grace in our community.

We pray that our fellowship may grow stronger as we meet in Hospitality Lunches next week, as we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word. We know we won’t be fully perfected until Jesus returns but we seek the Holy Spirit to work Your grace within us daily.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. May we be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that Your living Word goes deep into our hearts. Holy Spirit, we pray that You would change us from the inside out, to make us more like Jesus each day.

Knowing that we may make our plans but You guide our ways, we pray that the work of the Kingdom may prosper as Your Word extends outward from this place, In Jesus Name, Amen.
