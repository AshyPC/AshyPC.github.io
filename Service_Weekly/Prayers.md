## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 4th November 2018

__Jeremiah 32:40__ 
_I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear Me, so that they will never turn away from Me._

God speaking through Jeremiah

Let us remember that God is good - all the time, and that we can therefore come to Him with confidence:

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are good and do good to Your people. We thank You that You know all things and yet You have set Your love upon us despite our weaknesses, our failure to live as we ought in the Kingdom. We thank You that You do not forsake us but remain true to Your promises to us.

We thank You that because of Jesus only we can come into Your Presence. Because of His perfect sacrifice on the Cross, and His victorious resurrection from the dead, which we will celebrate today. We thank You that the Holy Spirit brings His life to us and we are thus inspired, so that we can show the world what it is to glorify You alone.

We thank You that Your covenant is everlasting, that Jesus now reigns and will reign forever, and we ask for Your strength to remain faithful in return, never turning away from You.

### The World 
We pray for our world which remains hostile to You and to Your people. We lift up to You the families and friends of those killed in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. We pray also for true peace for the nation of Israel and its capital, Jerusalem, the City of the Great King.

### The Church
While we thank You that we remain mostly undisturbed, we pray for Your people around the world who suffer for the Name of Jesus. There are so many places where it is dangerous to be together as we are today, and we pray for perseverance and courage for those members of the Body of Christ.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us. We pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries and we seek Your strength and courage to do the work of the Kingdom. We thank You that we can partake of the means of grace in the Supper, in prayer and in the reading and preaching of Your Word. We pray for those of our number who cannot be with us today. For those travelling, we pray for safe journeys and for those ill or injured we pray that Your healing hand would enable a swift recovery.

We pray for boldness in speaking of Your love, and for strength to do what is right at all times,  so that our words and actions together attest to the greatness of Your grace and mercy, and so that we may honour the Name of Jesus, for it is in His Great Name we pray all these things, Amen.

And now Eric will bring us our next reading today from the Gospel of Matthew.
