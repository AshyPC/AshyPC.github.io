## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 6th April 2025

__Psalm 143:1-2__ 
_[1] Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear to my pleas for mercy! In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness!_
_[2]  Enter not into judgement with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that You hear our prayers, because of Your righteousness, rather than our worthiness, for we have none. You are Good and Perfect, Loving and Merciful. Therefore we plead for mercy, not only for ourselves but for this world, which You have made but which we have spoiled, so that it lies under the Curse waiting for the end when Jesus returns.

We give thanks for the gift of our salvation because Jesus came as a helpless babe, lived the perfect life which we could not, and then won the victory over sin and death for us in the Cross and the Resurrection.

We look up and look forward to the future, with the sure hope that He will return, but not as the sacrificial Lamb but as the Righteous King of kings, bringing true justice to this world, and completing our salvation and sanctification.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
Father, we look at this world we live in and wonder how bad it could become. Internationally, we continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and we pray against the resurgence of anti-Semitism that remains strong around the world. We trust Your Word which declares that Israel remains Your chosen people, and we are Yours by Your grace alone. In this State, we again see bad laws being passed in our parliament to directly affect our freedom to speak the Good News to others. Yet we remain hopeful because You are the True God Who will see righteousness prevail.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We pray for our public witness to strengthen as we seek the man of Your choosing to lead in the work here. We continue to pray for the work of our Selection Committee and Douglas Milne our Moderator. Bless them with Your wisdom as we assess the candidates who come before us.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We especially remember Alan Freer, now making good progress in his rehabilitation at home, and Jan as she cares for him. We also give thanks for Diane Cocking maintaining her health.

We pray for our Community Group studies commencing soon. May they be a place where we can study Your Word and learn to live out the Christian life, caring for one another, bearing each others burdens, both in prayer and in practical ways.

We thank You for Your Word which calls us to recognise the witness of the Spirit, and to fix our eyes on eternal things, rather than the things of this world only. Help us we pray to look to You and remember through the Lordâ€™s Supper the great salvation You have provided in sending Jesus.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
