## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 2nd February 2025

__Isaiah 51:7-8__ 
    _[7]  “Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of man, nor be dismayed at their revilings._
    _[8]  For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool, but my righteousness will be forever, and my salvation to all generations.”_
   
__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we thank You that You have planted Your law into our hearts. We can praise You, not because we are good but because You are Good and Perfect, and gracious and merciful. We thank You for the gift of our salvation because Jesus began as a helpless babe, but went on to live the perfect life which we could not, and then won the victory over sin and death for us in the Cross and the Resurrection. We thank You that He is now ascended on high and intercedes for us. We thank You for the presence of the Holy Spirit our Comforter, Guide and Teacher of all truth. We thank You for the righteousness we enjoy because Jesus has given us His righteousness and taken away our weak, sinful, self-centred-ness, which kept putting us on the throne of our lives, instead of putting You there.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
In this world, we see so much of the reproach of man that it is easy to forget Your grace and instead become fearful and dismayed.
We thank You for the reminder of the true victory of the Cross and the Resurrection, as we share in the Lord’s Supper today, and as we bless one another in fellowship of the visible Body of Christ, the Church universal, which continues to grow daily under Your guiding hand. We remain hopeful because You are God With Us, as we recall Jesus’s promise that He would not leave us as orphans.

We continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and give thanks for the fragile ceasefire and the release of some hostages.

We pray for restoration of the Word of God as the dominant wisdom of our nation, for the Truth to be respected and honoured in public life and service. We pray that Your church would again be sought out as we uphold Your Word, firmly but graciously. We continue to pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You.

__Ashburton__
As well as our public witness, we pray for ourselves as we seek to keep the unity of the faith and encourage each other. We especially pray for Alan Freer, still in hospital after a setback with his recovery from the hip replacement surgery. We thank You for the skilled medical care he is receiving and pray for his strength to make a full recovery. We pray also for Douglas and Joan, giving thanks for Joan’s recovery so far, and pray for that to continue in full measure.

We pray for our congregational meeting to follow. Guide us into all wisdom as we set about the task of finding the man of Your choosing to lead in the work here. We pray that You would be already working in his life to prepare him for that calling to work in this part of the Vineyard.

We thank You for Your Word which calls us to seek to live according to the Truth as the Holy Spirit reveals it to us from Your written Word. May we always see Your Word as more than paper and ink but as the Living oracles of the One True God, Who sustains this world by Your Word.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.
