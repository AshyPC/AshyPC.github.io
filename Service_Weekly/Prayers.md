## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 10th September 2017

__Ecclesiastes 9:18__ _Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good._
__Psalm 56:11__ _in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?_

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, You are God over all, Creator and Sustainer of everything we see, and everything we can't see. Your great power is on display throughout this universe, which You brought into existence by Your Word alone. 

You made man in Your image, to obey You, the perfectly Wise ruler of Your Creation, and charged him to rule over this world according to Your Wisdom and righteousness. But Adam and Eve chose to reject Your rule over them, seeking wisdom from elsewhere.

We thank You for sending Jesus to undo what Adam did, to be our substitute, the Perfect One Who died in our place, taking our penalty upon Himself. Now by Your Holy Spirit indwelling us, we can be free of our past sinfulness, and we can submit ourselves to Your wise rule once again.

### The World and the Church
We thank You that Jesus' victory is complete and our redemption is secure, so that we can fully trust in You and not be afraid. We thank You for the Church the Body of Christ, where You have placed us as living stones, and where we are being built up into a new temple filled with Your praise. 

We thank You that we have Jesus promise that the Church will withstand the worst that the enemy can throw against it. But we acknowledge the truth of Solomon's words - that one sinner can destroy much good. We coontinue to pray for our nation to turn back to You, so that sinners are redeemed instead of unrepentant, and we pray for voters to lodge their postal votes in support of Godly order in marriage and family life. We pray also that our Parliamentary representatives would take heed of the results, and would act in accordance with Your heavenly wisdom for the good of the nation rather than enabling the destruction of what is good.

### Ashburton
We pray for the advance of the Kingdom work here, and focus again on the Holmesglen outreach. We ask that plans can progress to fruition. We also give thanks for the various ministries operating - ESL, elderlies ministry, for the youth work and the Friday fellowship and study group. We pray for increased wisdom, and as we grow in grace may we become more skilled in the use of spritual weapons, knowing that we battle for souls against an unseen but defeated enemy. We thank You that we need not be afraid for anything as we put our trust in You. 

Let us conclude our prayer with the words Jesus taught His disciples:

Our Father, Who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy will be done on earth, 
As it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those that trespass against us. 
Lead us not into temptation, 
But deliver us from evil. 
For thine is the kingdom, 
The power, and the glory, 
For ever and ever. 
Amen.

And now I will hand back to Barry.
