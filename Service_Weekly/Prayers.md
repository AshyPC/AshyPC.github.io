## Prayers for our World and the Church 

## 5th August 2018

__Psalm 80:17-19__ 
_Let Your hand rest on the man at Your right hand, the Son of Man You have raised up for Yourself. Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your Name. Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make Your face shine on us, that we may be saved._


Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we thank You that You are Lord God Almighty, Who did not leave us in our hopeless slavery to sin but You raised up the Son of Man, Jesus to deal fully and completely with sin and rebellion in mankind. 

We thank You Jesus, for comming into our world in obedience  to the Father to bring salvation to us, a salvation we could not achieve for ourselves, but granted by You as a gift, according to sovereign choice and purpose, based upon the finished work on the Cross.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life to bring the New Life of Jesus to us so that we are revived, made alive instead of remaining dead in our sins. We thank You for Your continuing Presence with Your people, to guide us, teach us and santify us daily. We thank You that You enable us to work in the Kingdom, to obey Your Word, and to see Your purposes established in this world and the next.   

### The World & The Church
We pray for our world which continues to turn its back on You. Yet we thank You that in other places people are choosing life instead. We see a world in which men seek wisdom in the wrong places, trusting in human ability and knowledge instead of turning to the only One Who is the true wisdom from above.

We pray for the work of the church, the Body of Christ which You have established as Your chosen instrument to bring the Good News of salvation to a needy world. Today we take part in the Supper, one of the means of grace which You have provided to strengthen and encourage Your people, so that we may persevere in the work of the Kingdom. We want to see more people come to know You, and to know the sure hope of eternal life and the blessed assurance of sins forgiven. 

### Ashburton
We continue to pray, as members of Ashburton Presbyterian, for this area where You have placed us as part of Your work to win souls. We thank You and pray for Your blessing upon our various ministries - Seniors centre, Youth and Young Adults, ESL, Sunday School, missionary support, and the Christianity Explored course currently in progress. May all of these help us to demonstrate the hope that we have as members of the Kingdom of Heaven, with an eternal perspective, looking for the city with foundations. And may those who do not yet know You see in us the light of life so that they too may become members of the Body of Christ.

We pray today especially for Tim & Sue Barber and for the McGrath clan as they mourn the passing of Hazel. We thank You that she is no longer subject to the weaknesses and limitations of this life. We thank You that her faith is now sight as she is with You in glory. Sustain and comfort her family and friends we pray. 

In all these things, whether joyous or sad, we seek to remain faithful to Your calling and the leading of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will make way for Englin to bring us the next reading from Scripture in Romans.
