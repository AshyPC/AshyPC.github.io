## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 12th January 2025

__Matthew 1:23__ 
    _"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel‚Äù (which means, God with us)._
    
[Thanks for Offering]

__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we thank You that we can gather today to bring You our praises, not because we are good but because You are Good and Perfect, and You are With Us. We have put away the decorations of Christmas and moved into a new year but we continue to give thanks for the gift of our salvation because Jesus came as a helpless babe, lived the perfect life which we could not, and then won the victory over sin and death for us in the Cross and the Resurrection.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
With our natural understanding, we look at this world we live in and wonder what the year has in store. We see so much trouble, division and unrest, yet we remain hopeful because You are God With Us. We continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and we pray against the resurgence of anti-Semitism that remains strong around the world. We trust Your Word which declares that Israel remains Your chosen people, and we are Yours by Your grace alone.

We also continue to pray that the Prince of Peace would bring the peace the world longs for, in the Middle East, Ukraine, and other trouble spots not reported in the news. In this State, where we have known large bushfires, we pray for those in California who have lost everything in the wildfires which are still raging.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We for those who came to the Carols on the Lawn. We pray that the seeds sown will bear fruit in changed lives. We pray for our public witness to strengthen during this year, even while we seek the man of Your choosing to lead in the work here.

__Ashburton__
As well as our public witness, we pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We especially pray for Margaret Sanders still recovering following her fall, and Alan Freer, in Casey hospital after two falls. We thank You for the skilled medical care he is receiving and pray for successful surgery to come. We also pray for Diane Cocking to maintain her health and thank you for the regular medical attention she receives for her heart condition.

We thank You for Your Word which calls us to see beyond our present situation, and to fix our eyes on eternal things. Help us we pray to look up to You and remember the great salvation You have provided in Jesus. We pray for opportunities to bless others wherever we go.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
