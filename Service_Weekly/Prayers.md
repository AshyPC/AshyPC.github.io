## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 13th August 2017

__Job 14:7-9__ _"For there is hope for a tree, when it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And its shoots will not fail. ... at the scent of water it will flourish and put forth sprigs like a plant._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord God Almighty, You are the Source of all life, and we thank You that in Your ever-living Word we find true hope. Whatever the visible situation, where there is life there is hope, as both Job and King David knew. We therefore turn to You and away from a world which wants to give up on some people before their time. 
We come before You alert to the fact that we can be influenced by the world's ways. We know we need One Who can save us from our own weaknesses and therefore we turn to Jesus, the only One Who has lived a perfect life. We thank You that You provided the Perfect Substitute Who has taken our place, and freed us from the guilt the power and the penalty of sin.

***
Because of Your great love for us who deserve nothing more than Your justice, we can come into Your Presence. We therefore rejoice at the prospect of sharing at the Table in the Lord's Supper, the foretaste of the Great Marriage Feast of the Lamb which is still to come.

We thank You that we can look forward to that event with a sure hope, knowing that our redemption is secure. We thank You that our hope is fed from Your Word which has been preserved and handed down to us through the ages, the Word fixed forever in the heavens, Your Word which is more secure a foundation for our faith than this Earth upon which we stand. 

### The World and the Church
That Word may be secure for us, but in this world there are those to whom it is an offense, and a cause for rebellion. We pray for this nation and for our Parliamentarians to retain the definition of Marriage which is presently in accord with Your Word, and Your Creation order. We pray for those who seek to overturn that definition. May they be defeated, and may the spiritual forces of darkness acting behind them be defeated also. We are alert to the real enemy working against Your Church and Your people. We affirm in the celebration of the Supper that he is a defeated enemy, whose rebellion against Your order has already been broken.

### Ashburton
We give thanks for Your goodness to us here in Ashburton, and for the faithful preaching of Your Word. We give thanks for the work of the College and the sound teaching which we receive as a result of the efforts of every person there: staff, students, faculty and administration. 

We pray for those among our number in need of Your special care today. We remember Eric, Jim and Muriel especially. We pray for the work to which You have called us in the Seniors ministry, Youth ministry, Holmesglen outreach, and ESL. May we minister Your grace in everything, Lord, so that whatever we do may be unto You. May those who receive the ministry be moved to praise You as the true source of our motivation and care for them, in Jesus' Name we pray, AMEN. 

And now we stand to sing "Sovereign Over Us".
