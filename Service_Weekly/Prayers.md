## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 16th July 2017

__1 Thess 5:16-18__ _Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
God in Heaven, You are Lord of All, and Your throne is beyond our reach, yet You are present with us as we gather. Although You hide Yourself from mankind because of sin, You reveal Yourself to those Whom You have redeemed. We thank You that You have called us out of darkness and into Your mavellous light, turned us from Your enemies into friends, and reconciled us to one another. We thank You that You have set Your love upon us and despite our daily imperfections, You remain faithful on account of Jesus and His victory at the Cross. 

### The World and the Church
We thank You for Your Church, Your chosen instrument to bring the Good News to a needy world. 
We pray today for Your sleeping Church, in places where it is safe, and where Your people are too much at ease because the war is a long way off. We pray that the Church would awake and be active about the business of the Kingdom, rather than taking it easy and becoming distracted and diverted from Your purposes. Grant us all clear vision and the courage to share the Good News to those we meet. We pray that our lives would be consistent with the words we speak, so that our message of life is heard and seen clearly by those around us. We pray that we would be attuned to the leading of the Holy Spirit as He works in the lives of our hearers.

### Ashburton
We thank You again for this joint Ashburton / South Camberwell congregation. We rejoice in Your goodness to us, and we pray for the work that You have set before us. As we plan ahead and work to build up the Youth Ministry, the Seniors Ministry and the Student Ministry to Holmesglen, we pray that we would remain in step with Your Holy Spirit. Help us to not run ahead or to fall behind but to recognise Your leading in everything we do.

We pray for our various needs, and in particular we remember Eric Edwards this week. We thank You for his rapid response to new medication. We also remember others who are not with us - Ruth, Jim, Diane, Nola and Manfred, Michael. Be with them wherever they are so that they wil lknow Your comforting presence. 

Let us close our time of prayer by reciting the words which Jesus taught His disciples

Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name.

Thy Kingdom come. 

Thy will be done on earth, As it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread,

And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those that trespass against us. 

Lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. 

For thine is the kingdom, 

The power, and the glory, 

For ever and ever. Amen.

And now Mook will bring our next reading from second Samuel chapter 11.
