title: Prayers for our church and the world 25 June 2017

__Psalm 145:18__ _The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, To all who call upon Him in truth._

Let us pray:
### Thanks to God
O Lord, Even though You are the Great Creator and the Sustainer of all that You have made, we thank You that You are near when we call upon You in Truth. 

We thank You that even though Adam and Eve turned their backs on You, and deliberately chose to be gods for themselves, You had mercy on them, so that their sin would be contained, and would not last forever. All humanity followed the downward path and we likewise were slaves of sin until You came and rescued us.  Jesus made possible the exchange of our sin for His perfect righteousness, lifting us from our impossible situation and turning us away from seeing ourselves on the throne of our lives to focus on Him, the true King of Kings.

### The World & The Church
We thank You that You care for us as individuals, but that You have placed us into the Church, the family of God, where we can relate to each other more closely than even our own natural families. We pray for Your Church to show Your love and care to each person according to their particular needs. We thank You for the many specialist groups which take Your love to places we can't reach personally: groups like Barnabus Fund, Samaritans Purse, missionary agencies, and support organisations such as MAF.

As today Scots Church focuses on chaplaincy, so we too pray for the chaplains who minister in schools, hospitals, emergency services, military posts, even sporting clubs. Grant them wisdom and discernment as they listen with compassion, so that people who may not even come to a church can still know Your love and care in tough times.

### Ashburton
We thank You that You are near us here in Ashburton also, even while You oversee Your whole creation. And so we ask for Your care for those who are in need - we remember Eric, Jim, Ruth, Hazel, Muriel, Michael and John.

We thank You again for new students in our ESL classes. As we come to the end of a term, we pray for refreshment for our teachers and helpers during the break, and we pray that our students may grow in confidence as they practice their English in real life situations. And when they return we pray that we can continue to help them as they tell us about the difficulties they encountered. In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.

And now Les will come to bring today's reading from second Samuel chapter 8.
