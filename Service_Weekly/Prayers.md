## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 30th November 2025

**Psalm 13:5-6** 
_[5] But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation._
_[6] I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me._

Let us pray…

**Thanks to God**
O Lord, we thank You that You have dealt bountifully with us, who deserved nothing but Your judgement for we were sinners in need of mercy. We thank You for sending Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, Who saved us.

We thank You that we have been forgiven by Your grace and mercy alone, and have been set free from the power of sin.

We thank You that You have given us a new heart and a renewed spirit within, so that we can sing and rejoice in Your salvation.

We thank You for sending the Holy Spirit, Third Person of the Trinity, to be with us daily, to come alongside and enable us to resist temptation, to open our minds to Your Word, and to grant us wisdom as we live in this fallen world.

**The Wide World... and the Wider Church**
As we approach the Advent season, when most people will here a distorted message about a baby in a manger, we pray for this world to hear the true story of God’s Son come to show the whole world how much You love us.

Where the constant message of the world is to give gifts which do not last, we pray that more will hear of the True Gift from heaven. Where there is only a superficial focus on families, we pray for more to know You as a loving Father Who has adopted them into His heavenly family. In a world where we hear of refugees and homeless wanderers, we pray for them to know Your call to a sure hope of an eternal home, living forever in Your loving Presence.

And we pray for the many churches where Your Word is faithfully preached and lived, and ask that You would strengthen Your people to stand firm (but with compassion), against the popular but false ideas of today.

**Ashburton**
We pray for our part in bringing this Good News of Great Joy as we continue preparations for our Carols on the Lawn service in two weeks time. Help us we pray to explain the familiar words of the carols so that our hearers will be able to know clearly Who Jesus is, and why He is the “Reason for the Season.”

We continue in prayer for those in need of Your healing hand – for Alan, Diane and others affected by illness or injury. 

We thank You for Your Word, and for Alan as he preaches today. We pray that we may grasp it more clearly, and live it out more fully, to make the most of the time we have.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
