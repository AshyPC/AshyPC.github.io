## Prayers for our World and the Church
## 23rd February 2025

__Lamentations 3:55-58__ 
    _“I called on your name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit; you heard my plea, ‘Do not close your ear to my cry for help!’ You came near when I called on you; you said, ‘Do not fear!’ “You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life._
   
__Thanks to God__
O Lord, we thank You that we can gather today to bring You our praises, not because we are good but because You answered when we called out to You. You came near when we needed to be rescued. You took up our cause and redeemed our lives by sending Jesus to Earth, to do for us what we could not. He took the penalty for our sin and nailed it to the Cross. Then You raised Him up in the Resurrection and exalted Him to the highest throne of Heaven.

__The Wide World... and the Wider Church__
With our limited natural understanding, we can look at this world we live in and wonder what is happening. But we pray for this world because You see everything, and know all, and we hold on to the fact that You remain sovereignly in control. We continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and give thanks for the release of hostages, even though that means distress for the families of those who died in captivity. We trust Your Word which declares that Israel remains Your chosen people, and that we are Yours by Your grace alone.

We also continue to pray that the Prince of Peace would bring the peace the world longs for, in the Middle East, Ukraine, and other trouble spots not reported in the news. We pray for the work of Your people missionaries and aid agencies which are ministering to the people fleeing those conflicts.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We thank You for the peace we enjoy here, and also for the work of Your people and churches bringing care to those in need within our own borders. We pray for continued strength for the workers of the Flemington Mission, for PresAID, and for the Mathys family as they work towards their return to PNG.

__Ashburton__
We pray for our public witness to strengthen during this year, even while we seek the man of Your choosing to lead in the work here. We ask for Your hand to be on the Selection Committee and Douglas Milne our Moderator, as they work to find that Godly one whom You are preparing.

We pray for ourselves as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, keeping the unity of the faith and encouraging each other. We especially pray for Alan Freer, in Kingston Rehab, as he works to recover fuller movement in his legs after the hip replacement. 

We thank You for Your Word which calls us to see beyond our present situation, and to fix our eyes on eternal things. Lead us Holy Spirit to become more diligent, more obedient and more faithful every day, as You plant the Word deep into our hearts. We pray for opportunities to bless others wherever we go.

In Jesus Precious Name we pray, Amen.
