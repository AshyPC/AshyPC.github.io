## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 7th January 2018

__Malachi 2:7__ _For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, as we begin a new calendar year, and as we refresh ourselves through this holiday season, we thank You that You are the One True God, Lord of Time and Eternity. Our times are in Your hands and we thank You for Your constant care for us.  

We thank You for Jesus, Who came into our world and humbly restricted Himself to the passage of time, in order to bring the only salvation which could be effective for all Your people both before and after His coming. Now we look forward to His return in glory when Your purposes for this era will have been fulfilled, and He ushers in the New Heavens and the New Earth.

### The World & The Church
As we look forward to the new year, we are eager to see what service You seek from us in the Kingdom. You have made Your people into a Kingdom of Priests, a Holy Nation, to declare Your praises.
We pray for Your church to fulfill that calling, for our lips to preserve knowledge, to provide instruction in godliness as messengers from Your very throneroom in heaven, such that more and more people would turn back to You. We pray for this world to know You through our daily witness.

We pray for the people of our nation and our State of Victoria to turn back to You as they see through the emptiness of mere human wisdom. May we be living examples to show that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

### Ashburton
Within our own congregation we pray today especially for Jim Gleeson in Knox Hospital. We espacially pray for Diane and the other members of the Gleeson family. Uphold them and encourage them we ask, and guide the medical staff as they seek to manage Jim's pain. We also want to remember Ruth Morrow's family and friends as they continue to adjust to her passing.

As we express our care and love for our fellow believers Lord, we remember that even in painful times You are good and Your good purposes will prevail. Today we will remember in the Lord's Supper that there is a time coming when sorrow and tears will be no more. In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask you to open your Bibles as MarJo brings today's second reading, from Psalm 90.
