## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 17th May 2020 

__Psalms 62:8__ _Trust in Him at all times, O people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that You are sovereign and nothing is beyond Your control. We thank You that we can put our trust in You even when we have not been able to gather in worship but have had to "meet" with the help of modern technology. We thank You that we are still able to sing Your praises and hear Your Word read and preached. 

We confess that there is a lot of fear in this nation and that the severe restrictions have done little to allay those fears, even while the impact of the coronavirus has been minimized. We thank You that so few lives have been lost to the virus and the main impact seems to be behind us.

### The Wider World ### 
We pray again today for continued efforts to reduce the impact of the virus in other places. We also pray for great wisdom in leadership as countries see the effect on their hospital systems and medical staff who minister to patients. 

We thank You that moves are now afoot to ease the restrictions in Australia. We pray that our governments may reverse the emergency powers steadily and allow life to return to its more usual form. We pray for the many people who have been out of work to be able to return as soon as possible. We know that You have created us to work rather than to be idle.

### and the wider Church ###
We pray that Your people everywhere may be bold and yet wise as our freedom of movement is restored so that we express our trust in You in everything we do. May we be beacons of light within our communities, living according to the Truth You have revealed to us in Your Word.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for wisdom for the Session, Board and other leaders as they plan ahead for the restoration of our various ministries.

Until then we continue to uphold Barry, Mook, the musicians and others who take part in our video services so that we are still able to hear Your Word read and preached. And we ask for Your encouragement in our own times of reading Your Word and praying for each other so that when we are able to meet again our fellowship may be enriched and stronger despite this time of separation.

In everything we do, whether in good times or in difficult times such as these, may we strive to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.
