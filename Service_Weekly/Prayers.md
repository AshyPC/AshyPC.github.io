## Prayer of Thanksgiving for Christmas Day

## 14th January 2024

__Psalm 7:17__ 
_I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness,_
_and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High._

#Thanks to God#
O Lord our God, we have gathered here today to worship You, to take up the words of David and give You thanks and praise because of Your righteousness. You created a world where mankind could live in joyful, productive submission to Your righteous rule, and where people could live at peace with each other. 

Yet, because of the Fall and the curse, man is not at peace with anything and we acknowledge that we need redemption because we are sinners who cannot save ourselves.

We thank You for the promised One who would come to crush the head of the serpent. We thank You that Jesus Christ the Righteous is the fulfillment of that promise, and the focus of our hope in Your perfect salvation.

#The Wide World... and the Wider Church#
In this world at this time, we see the sinfulness of mankind, showing how great is the need for Jesus. We have been saddened by the sudden re-emergence of hatred of the people of Israel, but we are not surprised that a world which has turned away from You should also turn away from Your chosen people. We pray for the peace of Jerusalem both spiritually and temporally as the nation remains at ware with sworn enemies.

Within our own nation we pray for victims of floods interstate in Queensland and NSW. We pray for all the rescue and restoration work, and especially for churches in and around the affected areas. May they be the visible hands and feet of the body of Christ, ministering in practical ways and showing Your love to flood victims.

We pray also for Your Church to continue to proclaim the Truth that Jesus is the Reason for the Season. When disasters are upon us, it is so easy to lose sight of the fact that You have extended mercy by sending Jesus to be our saviour. We pray that people will recognise the truth of what is preached, and respond in faith.

#Ashburton#
We pray for our local community to respond to the gospel, not only through our Carols service last month but throughout this new year. We pray for more people to hear that God has provided a sure Hope, full redemption because of His steadfast love. We pray that we would welcome those who come, build relationships with them and they might know the love of God as we reach out to bless them.

We recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We pray for us to grow towards spiritual maturity, using the means of discipleship, prayer and fellowship. We pray for those who are away, and especiually remember Barry & Suzanne on leave. Grant them spiritual rest and safe travels. We thank You for Mook and Talia and family returning from their time away also. 

We pray that You would restore those among us who are unwell or struggling in their circumstances, so that we may not be shaken as we look to Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, the God of our salvation,  Amen.
