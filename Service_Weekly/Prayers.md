## Prayers for our World and the Church 
### 20th July 2025

__Psalm 86:3-5__ 
_Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day. Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you._

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we can come before the throne of grace, that we can lift our souls to You. We thank You for the sacrifice of Jesus, Who opened the way back to You. We thank You that the temple of the Living God is no longer a forbidden place but a welcoming one.

We thank You that we have been released from the bondage to sin because of Your steadfast love, Your Perfect Goodness and Your gracious forgiveness.

### The Wide World... and the Wider Church
We cry out to You for this world where we see so much that is wrong, so much that is not according to Your Perfect will, and see so many who do not acknowledge the King of the Nations. We see hostility between individual people, between groups of people and between nations.

We recognise that there is much good in this world too, but our news is biased towards the bad and sensational, because that attracts our attention. We give thanks for every effort towards peace rather than violence and war but we also know that not all leaders deal honestly, and we don’t know enough to judge fairly. However, You see all, and we trust that this world stays in Your ultimate control.

We again pray for our nation, our State and our communities to turn back to You. We again see that bad news is easy to find but good news not so much. We long for the day when Your Word of Good News is respected once again. We pray for the continued work of Your Holy Spirit to turn back the hearts of men and women to You. 

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves here at Ashburton, as we seek to demonstrate Your grace to one another, and towards our family, friends and neighbours. We continue to pray for Alan Freer, as he progresses in his rehabilitation, for Diane, recovering after her operation, for Mook still recovering from the ‘Flu, and others affected by illness or injury. We thank You for the medical care we enjoy in this nation, knowing that You are the True Healer of our souls as well as our bodies.

We thank You for yesterday’s Ripple Effect workshop and the insights we learned from Julie-Anne Laird. Help us to seize opportunities to speak respectfully to others of the Lord we love to honour. We also pray for our study groups, as they learn from Your Word in our Hebrews series. Grant us clear minds to understand the meat of Your Word, and faithful hearts to live out the faith daily before a watching world. 

We thank You for Jake Martin bringing Your Word today, and ask that we ponder the great gift of grace and mercy You have poured out upon us. Help us as we take the eternal perspective, and take to heart the seriousness of Your final judgement on sin which we will see when Jesus returns.

In His Precious Name we pray, Amen.
