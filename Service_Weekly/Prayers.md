## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 13th November 2022

__Philemon 1-3__ 
_Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker – also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier – and to the church that meets in your home: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we gather in Your Presence in this place and no other, to praise You, Who saved us by Your merciful grace, and granted us peace with You through our Lord Jesus.
By sending Him – the One and Only – to be a ransom for the many, by putting our penalty for sin upon Him, and granting us His righteousness, You bridged the impossible gap between earth and heaven. Through His death and resurrection, You have adopted us personally into Your family. We are known to You personally, and Jesus dares to call us friends and brethren and fellow workers in Your coming Kingdom.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In this world we thank You for the work of Barnabas Aid in setting free prisoners of debt who were under bondage to their employers. Paul was a prisoner because of the gospel, but these workers have been set free because of the gospel. We do not experience the same financial bondage here, yet we thank You we as we paused on Remembrance Day to recall what it cost to retain our freedoms in this land. Now we pray for wisdom to know how to be Godly citizens of our nation and our State as well as heabenly citizens with an eternal hope.

We thank You that we can vote for our representatives, and we pray that the candidates and parties would be truly representative servants of the people, who also recognise that Your Law is their Higher Authority, and true wisdom is found in Your Word alone.

### Ashburton
In Ashburton, we thank You for Your work here and pray for the Elders, Board of Management and everyone who serves in leading and working for the sake of the gospel. We thank You for the unity which has been wrought by the Holy Spirit, so that others may see and know that Jesus is the only Saviour, and truly You are God Who cares for His people. We continue to pray for the Revitalization program, so that we can be a more effective channel for Your grace and mercy to reach this community.

We pray for those among us who need Your healing hand, especially remembering Diane, Russell, Jocelyn and Shiun.

We pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. May he expound it clearly so that we grow both in mind and spirit, in hearing and doing all that You  call us to do in this part of Your great and eternal Kingdom. These things we bring confidently before You, knowing that You hear us as we pray in the Name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Amen.
