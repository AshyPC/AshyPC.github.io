## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 20th August 2023

__Psalm 113:5-9__ 
_5 Who is like the Lord our God, Who is enthroned on high,_
_6 Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in heaven and in the earth?_
_7 He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the needy from the ash heap,_
_8 To make them sit with princes, With the princes of His people._
_9 He makes the barren woman abide in the house As a joyful mother of children._
_Praise the Lord!_

### Thanks to God
Father God, we praise You today, for You are enthroned on high, yet You humble Yourself to pay attention to Your Creation, and to us, who are poor in spirit and needing your grace daily. Knowing that we are powerless to save ourselves, we thank You that You sent Jesus to redeem us, so that we are changed from within, with a new heart to sing Your praises. You are the great God Who made all things, and yet You know us each by name. You are the One Who has lifted us, to sit with the Prince of Peace.

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
We pray for this world where most have turned their back on You. We see so much persecution in other places, and pray especially for Your people in Nigeria and Uganda. We also continue to pray for fellow believers in other places where it is death to own the Name of Jesus. But we also give thanks for the work of Samaritanâ€™s Purse and Operation Christmas Child, which brings hope to people in many parts of the world.

### Ashburton
We thank You for the work of grace here, seeing the gospel take root as people come to faith, one by one. We continue to pray for the progress of our Revitalization program, for the preaching of Your Word, and for us to be growing in Godliness towards spiritual maturity. We continue to recognise that Jesus is building His church and has called us to join with Him in the task. We seek to be prepared, ready to give an answer to those who want to know about our sure hope for the future, as we trust in Jesus, our Lord and Saviour, Amen.
