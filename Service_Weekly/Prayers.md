## Prayers for our World and the Church

## 22nd May 2022

__Psalm 48:10-11__ 
_As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth.
Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
Let Mount Zion be glad!
Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!_

### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we gather to give You thanks and praise today, as do so many of our brethren around the globe. We praise Your Name because You are the Righteous God Most High. Despite all we see around us of a fallen world, we thank You for Your Creation – Your beautiful handiwork shines through despite all that fallen mankind has done to blacken it. 

You promised Adam and Eve that One would come to defeat Satan and redeem mankind from the curse of sin. He would crush the serpent’s head in righteous judgement upon the perpetrator of all that is evil. At exactly the right time, Jesus came on His unique mission to defeat the accuser of the brethren, to lift the impossible burden from our shoulders, and to restore us as Your children, co-heirs with Him of all that He attained by His Victory on the Cross.

As we look back on Easter, the Ascension and Pentecost where the Holy Spirit came to indwell the Church we remember how complete is the victory that Jesus won, and again we rejoice!

### The Wide World... and in the wider Church
In the wider world which is yet to understand that joy, we continue to pray about the war and refugee situation in the Ukraine, especially for the aid workers being mobilised to help, and for the people displaced from the war zone. May they quickly find a safe haven away from the fighting.

We also want to pray for our Federal election outcome, to bring righteous government to our nation, so that the Rule of Law may be respected and Godly standards may be upheld. We pray for integrity inside and outside the Parliament, in the conduct of government business and our dealings with our elected representatives.

### Ashburton
Here in Ashburton, we pray for the elders, the Board and the leadership team working on our Revitalization program, as they seek to implement the vision to see more people in our community know the love of God, His gracious forgiveness and the joy of serving Him in restored wholeness. We pray that as a congregation we take up the challenge to be the visible demonstration of the love You have for us as Your people. May we bear the imprint of Jesus so clearly that others will want to know the God we love and serve.

We thank You for those who have recovered from recent sickness including Shiun, and for Diane dealing with a variety of medical concerns. We uphold her before You after she had some time in hospital last week, with persistent heart problems. Guide her doctors as they treat her with care and wisdom. We also thank You for Margaret’s medication stabilising the trigeminal neuralgia. 

We also remember Shon’s protective visa application and continue to seek the immigration minister’s favour in granting Shon full permission to stay in Australia. We pray also for Barry and Suzanne about to take some leave, and ask for thorough refreshing for them both. Grant them safety as they travel about and keep their minds at peace as they trust in You every day.

And now we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word today. May Your Word be always fresh and alive to our hearing, knowing that we live not by bread alone. And so we pray in anticipation in the Name of Jesus the King of Kings, Who reigns over all the affairs of man, Amen.
