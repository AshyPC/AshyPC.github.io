## Prayers for our World and the Church 

### 24th FEbruary 2019
__Romans 8:16__ _The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children._


### Thanks to God
Heavenly Father, we come before You today, remembering that we are no longer Your enemies, rebelling against Your good and perfect rule. We thank You that because of the perfect life, death and resurrection of Jesus we now are adopted children and members of the family of God, the household of faith. We count ourselves brethren of the Lord Jesus, Who is co-Creator and our coming King. We thank You that You have blessed us with the presence of the Holy Spirit, Who dwells within and reminds us of who we are in Jesus.

We pray that we would have our spiritual ears tuned to hear His voice clearly, despite the noise of the world around us. May we recognise His quiet voice more and more as we read, meditate on and study Your Word, but also as we go about our daily activities, when we could become so busy that we forget to listen for Him.

### The World and the Church

For this world, Lord, we pray for a realisation that human wisdom is of limited use and there is no answer to the perplexities of modern life apart from Your gracious provision. We pray that Your church may again become the respected witness to the means of grace, the Word of God. We pray that the truth of the gospel will displace the skepticism of modern day thinking, so that more people would know that there is only One Name under heaven by which we must be saved - the Name of Jesus.

### Ashburton
We pray for ourselves as Your servants in the work here. We pray for the Community groups which commenced this week, that they grow stronger and that each person may know Your presence and leading in the closeness of fellowship one with another. As the studies progress may we all become more effective "living letters" to those we meet, telling them in word and deed of our Great God and His love, so that more will be drawn to the Cross.

We pray also for the work of ESL as Evelyn takes up the role of ESL Co-ordinator. Lead and guide her in this task, bless the teachers and draw more students to the classes, and may we all find ways to share in the ministry of helping people with their conversational English. We pray also for the planning of a Famly Fun Day and more film nights to witness to families in the community around the church.

We also pray for those of our number who are in need of Your particular love and care. We especially pray for Muriel, Bruce, Diane and Ken.

Within the wider Presbyterian church we also pray for Keith and Jenny Bell, who lost their daughter Susannah to a massive stroke about a week ago. We thank You that Sussanah is at peace in Your Presence but we ask that You keep Keith and Jenny and the family strong as they cope with the tragic suddenness of the loss. Comfort them in their grief and bless them with the spiritual and practical support of their fellow believers at this time.   

We pray for Mook as he preaches Your Word today. May he be guided by Your Holy Spirit so that the words will have the full impact upon us that You intend. We pray that we may be fully attentive and that we would be able to put it into practice from this day forward.

In Jesus Great Name we pray, Amen.

And now Eric will bring our second reading for today.
