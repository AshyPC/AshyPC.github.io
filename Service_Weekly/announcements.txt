Tiffany one of our ESL students (a believer) is looking for new accommodation. If anyone has or knows of a place where a student can lodge for a manageable rental, preferably near a train station, please see me afterwards.   

You might have others to add but that is all in my diary. It’s good to draw congregation’a attention to items on the pew sheet. See you on 3rd.
