## Prayers for our World and the Church 
## including Prayer of Confession
### 6th June 2021

__Ps 143:1__ _Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear to my pleas for mercy!
	In Your faithfulness answer me, in Your righteousness!_

We come now to a time of prayer, to acknowledge God’s greatness, His perfection, to confess our imperfection, and to bring our requests to Him Who alone is able to effect lasting change, according to His purposes for the world and for us within it.

### Adoration
God Almighty, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Creator of all that is, we Your creatures dare to come before You only because You are merciful, faithful and righteous. From everlasting to everlasting, You alone are God, all-powerful, all-seeing, all-holy and altogether just! If we were to rely on Your justice, we would be lost, for we are fallen, warped by sin into self-centredness, so that of ourselves we would not seek You out.

### Confession
But because You are all-loving, and graciously merciful, we are not destroyed. We look back upon our week and recognise the times when we have failed, when we have not been holy as You are holy, when we have sullied the Name of Jesus our Saviour, when we have put down another person, thinking less of them and more of ourselves, when we have given in to temptation. We are ashamed of our thoughts, words and deeds and freely confess them to You now.

### Thanksgiving
Yet, we thank You that You have not abandoned us to our condition but rescued us from oblivion. We thank You for the special grace of salvation: while we were still sinners, Jesus came as the Sinless Perfect Son of God and Son of Man to take our place and suffer the penalty which we deserved, dying in our stead so we could go free.

We thank You that You raised Him up on the third day, defeating death and sin, and beginning the restoration of what was Your perfect creation. We thank You that there will be an end to sin when Jesus returns and institutes the new heaven and the new earth. Thereafter, we Your redeemed people and Your restored Creation will show forth Your glory without limit, forever and ever.

### Supplication: The Wider World
In the wider world, we continue to pray for the nation and the people of India, where the Covid19 virus is now in retreat as a result of effective measures taken by governments and the health system. We pray that their health systems will continue to function and will cope with the pressures still facing them, especially in rural areas where health facilities are not at the same standard as in the cities. We continue to pray for the distribution of aid and medical supplies.

Here in Victoria, we have more cases but we give thanks that there have been no fatalities and very few patients have been hospitalized. We continue to pray that our governments will employ all possible means to combat the spread of the virus.

### ... and the wider Church
We pray also for Your people in churches throughout the lockdown area. Strengthen us, keep us faithful even when we can’t meet face to face. Your Word urges us to continue meeting wherever possible but we recognise how difficult it is to do that and comply with the restrictions imposed by the state of emergency. We give thanks that regional Victoria has been freed from the most onerous restrictions and pray that people may resume normal life as quickly as possible.

### Supplication: Ashburton
Here in Ashburton we pray for Barry as he preaches Your Word, and we pray for our own understanding as we listen. May we be transformed by the renewing of our minds so that Your living Word goes deep into our hearts. Holy Spirit, we pray that You would change us so that we live our lives more and more in conformity to Your Word. As we face those factors preventing us from meeting, we pray that we will not be overtaken by discouragement but that we will resist the impact of our isolation and determine to maintain our trust in You and our support for each other. We pray that our fellowship continues to grow stronger each week, both in Sunday worship and in our community groups.

Finally, we pray for ourselves in the service of the Kingdom. We thank You that we are a part of the work of spreading the Good News, and members of the world-spanning Body of Christ. May we grow to show the character of our Risen Lord so well that others will see Him rather than us. 

In Jesus Name we pray, Amen.
