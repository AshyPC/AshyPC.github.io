## Prayers for Good Friday

### 10th April 2020

__2 Tim 2:13__ _If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself._

### Thanks to God
Father God, we thank You that because of Jesus sacrifice, we can spend eternity with You.

Today is the saddest day in our calendar as we face up to the fact that it was necessary for Him to suffer and die on the Cross for our sin.

Because of Your great love for us we, who have followed in Adam's sin are now able to walk free. You remained faithful to us even as You watched us turn away from You.

Jesus has once and for all taken the punishment that was ours, removed the guilt which we bore and given us in exchange His perfect righteousness so that we can rejoice in Your Presence. 

Living in Australia we acknowledge that we are comfortable and safe, and take so much of Your blessing for granted. Our hearts are dulled and we have forgotten the greatness of Your love towards us.

Awaken our hearts again, stir us up to see how great a salvation Jesus has won for us, so that we cannot help but speak of the wonderful things of God to our friends and neighbours, our families and work colleagues. 

May we have the boldness shown by the early believers who demonstrated their love by their actions. May everything that we do and say express Your love to others. May we always strive to be a blessing, especially in difficult times such as we face now with the coronavirus restrictions in place.

As we give to support the work of the Chaplaincy Committee today we also pray for the Committee and all the chaplains, full time and part time who give of themselves to serve in prisons, the military, police and emergency services and in hospitals.

We especially remember Suzanne who serves at the Royal Children's Hospital, and we pray for the chaplains supporting front line medical staff during this coronavirus period.

In everything we do, whether in good times or hard times such as these, may we strive to make known Jesus Great and Precious Name, in which we pray all these things, Amen.
