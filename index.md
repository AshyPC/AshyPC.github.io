# Welcome to Ashburton Presbyterian Church!

[Merry Christmas from Ashburton Presbyterian Church 2015](https://www.dropbox.com/s/by6ndgw7od6iqjx/2015_Christmas_flyer.png?raw=1)

We are a group of ordinary people who know, love and follow Jesus. We believe He is at work in our world through the ordinary and we desire to be part of that work.

Our focus is "Sharing Jesus' love with our community." We are passionate about people learning about Jesus and coming to know Him. We want to spread His fame. This begins with our own lives, and extends into our homes, workplaces, schools, TAFEs and universities, our businesses, shopping centres, and throughout our city.

In "sharing Jesus' love with our community" we take seriously the things He said are important. Jesus said that everything God requires of us is summed up in loving God with all we have and all we are, and then loving our neighbours in the same way we love ourselves. This is the ‘Great Commandment’ and you can read it in Matthew 22:37–40. As part of loving our neighbours we also obey His command to make His fame known so people may believe, have eternal life, and learn from Him. This is the ‘Great Commission,’ and it is found in Matthew 28:18-20.

_Finding solid ground in Christ_

_He lifted me out of the pit;_

_He set my feet on a rock_

_and gave me a firm place to stand._

_Psalm 40:2_
