# Our Vision

## “Sharing Jesus’ love with our community.”

Our vision is to be a community that embodies the love of Christ and shares that love with our community, by our words and actions, with the express desire that many people may, by God’s grace, believe and trust in Jesus, and in turn be influential in leading others to also become followers of Jesus.

- Sharing arises both from what we do and what we say.
James 2:17 (ESV): “So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” 
Romans 10:17 (ESV): “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”

- It is Jesus’ love that we share. This love in ultimately expressed in Jesus’ death on the cross in our place for our salvation.
John 3:16 (ESV): “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”

- That love is shared in word and deed firstly with our community.
1 Peter 3:15 (ESV): “but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect…”

You might say that we try to take seriously the <big>Great Commandment</big> (see Matthew 22:37-40) and the <big>Great Commission</big> (see Matthew 28:18-20).

We want to see people becoming disciples of Jesus in our community and wider – so we also have an interest in being a sending / church planting church. We are a small church with big plans, because we serve a big God!
