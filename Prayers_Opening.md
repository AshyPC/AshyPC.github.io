## Call to Worship / Opening Prayer

## 5 Feb 2017 

__1 Timothy 1:17__ _Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen._

Let us worship the Lord together.

Let us stand for our first hymn "How Great Thou Art" [MP 506]


### Adoration
Lord, God Almighty, King of the Universe, we gather today to proclaim Your Greatness, to worship before You, to sing Your praises and to hear Your Word read and preached, and to obey Your voice.

You are the Great Creator, Who made a perfect world - everything from the stars above to the tiniest cells in our bodies, You made to manifest Your power and glory, Your mercy and grace, Your Wisdom and purpose.

### Confession
We see in Your Word that Adam and Eve failed to fulfill the purpose for which You made them - to be perfect stewards of Your creation, and therefore the world was subjected to the Curse, and today is still groaning under the weight of sin. 

Yet in Your Eternal foreknowledge, the remedy for this was already prepared, and at the right time You sent Your Son to become a man, to save sinful man from the consequences of his disobedience. 

We thank You that You did for us what was impossible - You bridged the chasm between Your holiness and perfect righteousness and our rebellious, sinful weakness. You drew us back to Yourself even though we did not want to face up to the truth of how lost we were in sin, and Your grace was sufficient to overcome our fears and turn us back to You. 

Even now we acknowledge that we are still imperfect, but we thank You that by Your Holy Spirit You are changing us daily to be more and more like Jesus, the perfect Man Who is also God come down to us.

We thank You that as we gather together we can encourage one another to leave behind the old habits that dragged us down, to grow in grace, to spur one another onwards to love and good works and to see Your purposes for others in this community.

As we gather today, we pray that You would lead us and guide us by the Holy Spirit so that all we do and say is acceptable to You, motivated by hearts fully devoted to You. 

Let us conclude with the words Jesus taught His disciples:
Our Father, Who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory
For ever and ever  Amen.


And now Margaret has some important announcements for us all.
