Introducing God

 

If you are interested in finding out more about Jesus, you may like to participate in Introducing God.

It is a 9 week programme that takes you for a tour of the Christian worldview with its personal implications. It is done in a friendly and non-judgmental environment where people are encouraged to openly share their views and their stories.
