Now about the working bee.
Les will not be there but he has prepared a list of tasks.
So the idea is that those who would like to help, look at the list and indicate a job or jobs they would do at some other time. Then sign off or tick when they had completed it (them).

(As you know the numbers at the working bees has really fallen off. Last time there were only four of us for most of the time. So the upkeep is falling on a few shoulders.)
