## What we do

We seek to learn together, support one another, and jointly take the good news about Jesus to our community. As a church, we seek to balance what we do between nurturing and growing believers in their faith and sharing our faith with those who don’t know Jesus.

### We do not seek to be a ‘one-stop shop’ for everything spiritual, rather, we believe:

as followers of Jesus we should not be consumers of services, but producers, active in serving Christ (and each other) with our spiritual gifts and natural talents.
the church is organic – Paul depicts it as a ‘body’ of people with differing gifts and Jesus as the Head; Jesus pictures us as branches that have spiritual life by being connected to the vine. In the composition of the church at any point in time, God determines the gifts that are present. This means that our approach is not to establish a set of ‘must-have’ ministries and seek people to fill job descriptions, but rather to focus ministry on using the gifts of the people God has put in the church at the time.
ministries are best developed from the ground up, not from the top down. We encourage people to pursue their passion, gifting and the sense of call from God in establishing and undertaking ministries. Our ESL ministry is the result of such an approach. At the same time, the elders ensure that the ministries are consistent with the church’s vision under the leading of the Holy Spirit, and are periodically reviewed against our goals.
At present, church life is organised around…

### Sunday gathering is an opportunity to worship together, learn from God’s word and encourage one another. We believe that our worship together is important for our life of worship during the week (Rom 12:1).

Hebrews 10:23–25 (ESV): Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.

### We also gather together twice a month on Sunday evenings simply to pray.

### Community groups are an integral part of the life of the church and everyone is encouraged to belong to a group. Groups comprise around 10-12 people who meet weekly in homes during school terms.

Community groups are more than Bible studies – they are sharing life together.

- We learn from God’s Word together and support each other in sharing and prayer.
- We seek to deepen relationships in Christ with each other, and pastorally/practically care for one another, as need arises.
- We enjoy each other’s company in meals or outings together.
- We seek opportunities to do good to our neighbours /community through acts of service.
- We intentionally support each other in reaching out to non-Christian friends and neighbours, particularly seeking opportunity to witness as ‘community’, by inviting them to join with us in ‘everyday’ social activities.

### English as a Second Language (ESL) classes provide an opportunity to show Jesus’ love to ‘new Australians’ by helping them in their need to communicate, understand culture and adjust to a new life. Classes presently run during the day and evening on Thursdays and focus on conversational English at different levels of ability. Many participants are keen to understand more about the Christian faith.


### An Easy English Bible Study

### Special events such as our Family Fun Afternoon, presence at community festivals and international lunch with ESL students enable us to raise awareness of the church and build relationships within the community. We are always looking for ways to connect with the community.
