## Prayers for our church and the world

## 5 Mar 2017 

__Psalm 49:7-8__ _No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them - the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God we have gathered here today to worship and praise You, to lift up the Name of Jesus, and to honour You in Your Presence with us by the Holy Spirit. We thank You that You are the great God above all gods, the One Who made the heavens and the earth, Who sustains them in all their marvellous intricacy, the One Who gives us life, and the One Who redeems us. For we agree with the Psalmist that from our merely human perspective, no one can redeem a life, no payment is ever enough. And yet, when Adam and Eve sinned and forfeited the heavenly life You gave them originally, the Curse was not enough to overturn Your purposes in creating man to worship You. 

We thank You for Jesus, Who came to do the seemingly impossible and redeem us - He paid the ransom we could not pay - and in so doing, He overturned the Curse so we could be free of the guilt and the power and the penalty of sin. Today we celebrate with bread and wine in remembrance of the Cross, the instrument He used to win complete victory over the evil one, and the Resurrection, Your power at work establishing the Kingdom of Heaven. We also look forward in hope that He will come again some day not as a sacrificial lamb, but as the Lion of the tribe of Judah in power and majesty to take visible charge of this Kingdom. 

### The World & The Church
We thank You that final victory is sure, and yet we live in this world in between to commencement and the conclusion of the Kingdom. We pray for Your Church which cannot be overthrown, but which seems at this time to be weak, and our world is running away from the message of the gospel to chase after other gods of self and wealth, ambition and power.

We pray that we members of Your church would always be focused on the work of the Kingdom, and not distracted by the vanities of this world. We know that the enemies of the Truth are perpetually on the attack. As we saw in Your Word last week, their persistence is wearisome but it need not defeat us. Strengthen Your church to resist the devil so that he flees from us.

### Ashburton
We pray for the work here, that You would continue to protect andprosper our efforts, and we especially pray for our ESL students, many of whom have yet to return this year. We are concerned for them, Lord, and want to continue helping and encouraging them in their studies.

We thank You for everyone who is here to join in the celebration of the Lord's Supper, and we remember again those who can't be with us. We continue pray for Les Oliver and for his workload to ease. Grant him peace during his recovery and restoration. 

As we pray Lord, we are conscious that You are the One Who does these things, and we are meant to be channels of Your love to others - both those here in fellowship and those not here and with whom we share the Good News of Grace. Help us to remove any blockages that would prevent us from fully obeying You, in Jesus Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask MarJo to bring us today's second reading from Matthew chapter 24.
