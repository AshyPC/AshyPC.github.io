## Prayers for our church and the world

## 12 Feb 2017 

__Psalm 31:14-15__ _But I trust in you, Lord; I say, 'You are my God.' My times are in your
hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord we thank You that You are our God, just as You are David's God. And because You are the Eternal God Who is "from everlasting to everlasting," You see our past, present and future all together, so we can say with him that our times are in Your hands. As we prepare to embark on changes we entrust ourselves into Your care, knowing that You see the end from the beginning, whereas we can only see a little of what lies ahead.

We thank You Lord that You are also Lord of our past, and today we give thanks for our heritage, for those who have gone before us - both the Reformers of 500 years ago, and those ministers and missionaries of the gospel who brought the Word to this land.

### The World & The Church
We know that in every age, imperfect men have made errors, besmirched Your Name, and failed to live according to the Truth of Your Word. Yet, we thank You that the Holy Spirit has preserved the Truth, and You continue to work to extend the Kingdom, win people away from a defeated enemy, and strengthen Your Church.

We pray for those charged with the task of preaching Your Word, and those who train our preachers and teachers. We pray that You would continue to guide and guard the work of the Theological College, and uphold Peter Hastie the Principal, all the staff, and the students as they learn to rightly handle the word - the very oracles of God. We also pray that we ourselves would be diligent students of Your Word, so that we can see for ourselves what You are saying to us, and that we can make it a daily part of our spiritual nourishment.

### Ashburton
We thank You for what You are doing here in Ashburton. We thank You for everyone who is here, and we remember again those who can't be with us: Barry & Suzanne enjoying a break, and we bring before You Jim Gleeson and Diane as she takes care of him. May they both know Your close comfort daily.

We thank You for the resumption of our ESL classes, and for the first new students who have enrolled on day one. We pray for more of our previous students to return in the coming weeks and for the new activities, which we pray will enable them to practice their new-found skills.

As the Body of Christ in this place we thank You that we are here to serve, rather than to be served, and so we commit all these things to You, for the purposes of the Kingdom, in Jesus Name, Amen.

And now I will hand over to Margaret Sanders to bring our second reading for today, from Matthew's gospel.
