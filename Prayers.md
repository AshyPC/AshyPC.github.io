## Prayers for our church and the world

## 8 Jan 2017 

__Psalm 7:9-10__ _Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure - You, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts. My shield is God Most High, Who saves the upright in heart._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your Presence today to offer our thanks and praise. We know that we come only because Jesus has paid the price for us to be redeemed and restored. For You are Perfect in Holiness and righteous in Your very character, while we are descendants of Adam and Eve. There are no secrets we can hide from You since You probe our minds and hearts, and You know us through and through. Yet, You sent Jesus, You brought us back from our past rebellious state to again become the righteous. We rely on Jesus' righteousness to remain secure, to be shielded, to be saved.


### The World & The Church
We pray for Your church which in many parts of the world is in distress, whether through violence or through distress and natural disaster. We thank You for the means of sharing our material blessings via PresAID with the Church in Africa, and we pray for security for Your people in Malawi and Zambia in particular. As You were a shield to David, and You are a shield to us here, we pray You would be a shield to Your people there. 

### Ashburton
We thank You that we as Your Ashburton church are partners in the work of the gospel and we pray for each step of progress in extending the Good News of salvation to others around us here. We pray that we be always alert to find those who are upright in heart, whom You have marked for salvation and inclusion in the Kingdom.

### Prayer for the Word
And we thank you for the written Word and that you reveal to us the way to live through your Word. We pray that we will increase our reading, study and meditation during this new year, and we will store your Word in our hearts more fully, so that we understand more thoroughly what You have called us to do here, and therefore live daily in greater conformity to Your Will, in Jesus Name we ask, Amen.

And now I will hand over to MarJo who will bring our second reading for today, from Matthew's gospel.
