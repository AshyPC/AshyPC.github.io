## Prayers for our church and the world

## 5 Mar 2017 

__Psalm 45:4__ _In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and
justice; let your right hand achieve awesome deeds._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God we come into Your Presence to thank You that for Who You are. We look to You as the God of truth and justice, of humility, grace and mercy, and the God of awesome power. You see and know all, and You have everything under control. You sustain the entire universe by Your Word of command, and everything is done to fulfill Your purposes and manifest Your glory. 

We thank You for Jesus, Whose first coming was humble, to provide for us the salvation we needed, the sinless One dying for all of us sinners. We thank You that He is also Your Prophet, speaking Your Word truly, teaching it fully and because of His sacrifice and the resurrection, He is the Reigning King of Kings, Who will come again some day in power and majesty to judge the living and the dead, with a Righteous judgement that no-one will be able to dispute. 

### The World & The Church
We thank You that we can pray for our world where many still refuse to bow the knee to the coming king. We especially remember today the work of Compassion India which faces a crisis in its work and dealings with the government of India. We bring before You Lord, the many children who are blessed by the ministry of Compassion India, both through the local partner network, andthe Australian supporters and sponsors of the children. We pray that You would move the government officials to remove the restriction on incoming funds which has prevented Comopassion India from ministering as effectively it did before. Unless something changes soon, they will have to close down their operations completely, which will greatly grieve all the sponsors and the children. 

We are a long way from the situation, and we acknowlege that You sometimes work in ways we don't understand, so we pray that the situation may be resolved so that Your purposes may be fulfilled, that Your love may continue to be shown to the Indian staff, partners and the children themselves. 

### Ashburton
We thank You that we don't face that kind of problem here in Ashburton. But we pray that You would continue to protect Your work, for wherever the gospel goes, opposition arises.

We thank You for everyone who is here, and we remember again those who can't be with us: we bring before You Jim Gleeson and Diane, for Eric, Ruth, Michael, Nola and Manfred.

We pray particularly for Les as he recovers after the hip replacement surgery last Tuesday. Grant him speedy recovery and full restoration. 

As we pray Lord, we are conscious that You are the One Who does these things, and we are Your humble servants working to fulfill Your purposes in this place, andgrowing in obedience as we submit ourselves to the authoprity of Your Word. With the Psalmist we pray that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts would be acceptable in Your sight, Amen.

And now I will ask you to take up your Bibles and follow today's reading from Matthew chapter 23.
