## Prayers for our church and the world

## 15 Jan 2017 

__Malachi 2:7__ _For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth._
and
__1 Peter 2:9__ _But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord our God, we give You thanks and praise for the gracious choice You have made to bring us into Your kingdom and make us a part of your holy nation. We thank You that You have called us to be priests, serving under Jesus our High Priest, to bring the knowledge of Your salvation to many around us, to declare Your praises, not only to encourage one another within but also to tell those still in darkness about Your marvellous light.


### The World & The Church
We pray for Your church and for those Whom You call together to fulfill Your purposes. We thank You that You draw together those whom You call to a task, and bring them into fellowship together. As living stones, You build up Your church day by day, and nothing can prevent You achieving Your goals.

### Ashburton
We thank You that Ashburton is also a part of what You are doing in this community. We thank You for everyone whom You are gathering to the task: Barry and Mook, along with those joining in the re-plant mission, and all of us as members of the congregation. We pray for the strength and encouragement of the Holy Spirit as we aim to fulfill our calling as priests upholding the Truth, and instructing others, declaring Your praises as we hear the Word read and preacheed, and as we sing to Your Glory, in Jesus Name we ask, Amen.

And now I will hand over to Les who will bring our second reading for today, from Matthew's gospel.
