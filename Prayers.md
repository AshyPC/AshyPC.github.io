## Prayers for our church and the world

## 1 Jan 2017 

__2 Cor 5:17-18__ _...if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: the old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
Father God, You are the Lord of Time and Eternity, and we are limited in this life to the passage of time. We thank You as we close a year and look forward to a new one that You know what it is to live within our world. Jesus came and waited patiently for thirty years to pass before He commenced His public ministry. We thank You that through His life, death and resurrection, You reconciled us to Yourself.

We thank You that we remember in the Lord's Supper what He want through to bring us back into fellowship. We thank You that You have made us anew, that we are new creations, and we have a new task - instead of living for ourseleves, You call us to share the news of this reconciliation with others.

### The World & The Church
As we commence a new year, we pray for Your church which has suffered much in recent times. We pray for Your people still suffering persecution, and we pray for the church in comfortable freedom. Help us to see that this world is still opposed to what You are doing, and we pray that the comfortable church will arise in the strength of the Holy Spirit, guided by Your Word alone, to declare that Your great grace is still available until Jesus returns. 

### Ashburton
We thank You that we also see new things happening within our midst. We give thanks for the "old things" which have served their purpose, and pray for the new things to come, as we extend ourselves into further service beyond what we have been accustomed to in the past. We thank You for our unity of purpose and pray that it may continue as we discuss ways and means of achieving Your purposes here. We pray that we can use our time wisely - neither rushing into things without careful thought, nor holding back too long and thus missing opportunities for service. Help us, we pray, to do the work according to Your timing.

We pray that in all these things we may keep in step with Your Holy Spirit, to Your honour and glory, in Jesus Name, Amen.

And now I will ask Suzanne to bring the second part of our reading from Matthew's gospel.
