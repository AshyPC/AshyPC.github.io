# Prayers for our church and the world

## 18 Dec 2016 

__Malachi 1:5__ _You will see it with your own eyes and say, "Great is the Lord - even beyond the borders of Israel!"_

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that You are indeed great beyond the Borders of Israel. You are greater than any national gods and greater than anything we could put in Your place, for You made the heavens and the earth. You stretched out the starry host like a curtain, and the wonders we can see with our eyes or our telescopes are still but a small indication of Your great power.

We thank You also that You made us in Your likeness, and called us into fellowship with Yourself. But we acknowledge that Adam sinned and we have inherited the consequences of that great Fall, and the responsibility and guilt of following in his steps. But we thank You that You foresaw all of this, and planned for Jesus to come to our rescue. 

### The World & The Church
We see a world still lost and in need of rescue, happy to enjoy Christmas but mostly ignoring Easter, and we pray for those who welcome the Light of the World now, but want to snuff it out because in His Light their darkness is made obvious.

We thank You that Jesus came, as foretold by Your prophets, and was fully obedient to Your Will - and we admit that we are not obedient. We thank You that despite our failings, You have graciously chosen us to receive His righteousness as easily as putting on a robe. 

We thank You that there are many others also marked out for salvation, and You have built Your church to carry the joyful news to all the world, far beyond the borders of Israel. We pray for Your church to awaken once again to its task as the army of God, which You direct towards regaining captured territory, and releasing captives from the hands of a defeated enemy.

May Your whole church see that it is led by a Commander Who is no longer a babe, but is the victorious King of Kings, the One Who has conquered death on behalf of all Your people.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray for the plans to bring a cross-cultural worker to join us here. We thank You for the Presbytery and Ministry Development Committee, for the wisdom they exercise in carefully evaluating these plans. 

We thank You that You have called us to be a part of Your army. We commit ourselves to diligent obedience to Your Word, and faithful service in the Kingdom, as we humbly bring these our prayers in the Great Name of Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory, Amen.

And now I will ask Les to bring the second reading, which will be from Matthew's gospel.
