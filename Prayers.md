# Prayers for our church and the world

## 18 Dec 2016 

__Malachi 1:5__ _You will see it with your own eyes and say, "Great is the Lord - even beyond the borders of Israel!"_

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we have gathered today to remember what You have done for us in sending Jesus to take our place. As we celebrate the Supper, we encourage one another to look forward in hope for the return of the victorious King of Kings.
We thank You that You have not forsaken Your people, and we take heart from the reassurance that You gave the returned exiles. We thank You that You call us to work with You.

### The World & The Church
We look about us at a world still lost and largely ignoring the sacrifice of Jesus at Calvary, and we realise that there is always work to do. We realise that many scoff at the idea of God becoming man, but we pray that Your church would remain firm in holding to the truth, and firm in the face of laws restricting religious freedom, which are once again before our State parliament. We pray for wisdom when the vote is taken, so that the Bill is defeated and does not return.  

As we approach the Christmas season, we pray for the true message of the first coming of the Saviour to be heard and understood, despite the superficial holiday atmosphere that normally prevails. We pray that we would never forget that we too were once lost in sin, and we were drawn to the foot of the Cross by Your grace alone. Help us to see and grasp opportunities to speak to friends, family and neighbours. May the familiar words of the carols be a means of witnessing to the Truth of the Word Who became one of us, so that we could be redeemed and restored.

### Ashburton
We continue to pray for the plans to bring a cross-cultural worker to join us here. We thank You for new ESL students even this week, and pray for more workers to join us here in this harvest, as we aim to serve them. We thank You for Tat and Julie's return but pray for Tat recovering from pneumonia. Meanwhile, we continue to pray for Jim in rehab, we thank You also for Hazel's improvement, and we thank You for Jenny's improvement with chemotherapy.

In all things we remember that You have provided for us in every way necessary through Jesus, and it is in His Great Name we pray, Amen.

And now we will stand to sing, before we hear the second of today's readings from Scripture.
