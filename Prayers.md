## Prayers for our church and the world

## 12 Feb 2017 

__Psalm 34:3-4__ _Glorify the Lord with me: let us exalt His Name together. I sought the Lord
 and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord we thank You that You are the Great GOd Who made the heavens and the Earth, and that we are here together to praise Your Name, and to glorify You as a body of Your redeemed people. We thank You for the greatness of Your power displayed in Your Creation, as well as the greatness of Your mercy and grace in saving a lost humanity by sending Jesus.

He came to live and minister in this world as a humble servant, and then to die a death He did not deserve, to defeat an enemy who was too powerful for us. We thank You that He won back a rebellious people and You raised Him up to life again, so that death could no longer hold us in fear.

### The World & The Church
We thank You that You have graciously called and chosen us to be part of Your new kingdom, and to work within it as Your partners in sharing the Good News of Jesus' victory.

We thank You that You have placed us all within the Body of Christ so that each has a part to play, and the Holy Spirit oversees us all, so that Your purposes are fulfilled everywhere that You work. We thank You for those whom You call to go to other nations, and we pray in support of people like Calvin and Ruth. Sustain them, we ask, as they work in foreign lands with people of unusual customs and unfamiliar languages.

### Ashburton
We thank You also for what You are doing here in Ashburton. We work in familiar surroundings, and yet we also find ourselves ministering to people from foreign lands with unfamiliar languages.

We thank You for our ESL classes, for the new students who enrol each week, and we pray for more of our previous students to return soon. We also pray for those who are moving into new ventures, as they find their way in a strange country. Allay their fears, we ask, Lord, so that they can travel and work with confidence as they become more comfortable with their new skills in English. 

We thank You for everyone who is here, and we remember again those who can't be with us: we bring before You Jim Gleeson and Diane as she takes care of him, and Eric Williams, and his carers at Iris Manor. May they all know Your close comfort daily.

We thank You Lord that we gather today to worship in a different format but retaining the essentials, as we sing and pray, we read Your Word and listen and learn as we are taught from it. Help us to examine and test all we do, to hold fast to what is good and to not be fearful of making changes, but to trust in Your leading so that we do all things to the honour and glory of Your Name, Amen.

And now we will stand to sing our next hymn. And this is the first time I have announced that the children will be moving out to Sunday School.
