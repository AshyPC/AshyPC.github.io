## Prayers for our church and the world

## 29 Jan 2017 
(David  when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.)

__Psalm 18:28__ _You, Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord we thank You that You are David's Rescuer, Protector and Ever-Present Guide. And because You are the Eternal God not limited by time as we are, You are also our Protector and Guide. David sang of Your great Power, but also of Your great Wisdom, Your concern for the humble rather than the proud, Your Perfection and Righteousness in all Your being.

### The World & The Church
Lord, we pray for our nation of Australia as we have just celebrated "Australia Day". It is sad to see how divisive some choose to make it since in Your Goodness You have blessed us with so much in this land. 

Help us to remember to be thankful at all times for the freedoms we enjoy, and to take up our responsibilities to be worthy citizens. We know that our first allegiance is to the King of Kings, but we also pray for wise government, for upright leaders, for disciplined and thorough debate in our Parliaments and for laws that promote godliness and punish evil.

We continue to pray about the mayhem in the city that has cost five lives so far. We pray for the restoration of the injured, and we pray for churches and chaplains showing Your compassion and bringing some comfort to all those affected by this tragedy.

### Ashburton
We thank You that Kingdom work continues in Ashburton. We thank You for everyone whom You are gathering to join the task. We remember again those who can't be with us today: Margaret Sanders recovering from foot infections and needing to rest, we uphold Peter Jelleff seeking for successful post-operative treatment for his eyes. And we bring before You Jim Gleeson and Muriel French. May they both know Your close comfort daily.

We pray for ourselves too. As the summer holidays end and people get into the swing of a new year, we pray that we would know the empowering work of the Holy Spirit within this place. As we look forward to launching the re-plant, may we see this as a new beginning, a new generation of Your people, something like the nation of Israel crossing the Jordan into their new home. We may be apprehensive about the unknowns, but we are confident that You are leading us and therefore we can be also bold and courageous, like Joshua.

We pray all these things in Jesus Name, Amen.

And now I will ask MarJo to bring our second reading for today, from Matthew's gospel.
