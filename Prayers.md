## Prayers for our church and the world

## 19 Feb 2017 

__Psalm 37:23-24__ _The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in Him; though he may
stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord we thank You that we can gather freely in Your Presence today. We thank You that we can sing Your praises, delight in Your goodness, enjoy the beauty of Your creation and make use of all the bountiful provision that You put within our charge.

We thank You for Jesus coming to provide for us the salvation we needed most, for His righteousness given to us who don't deserve it. He obeyed You fully, knowing what He was to endure, and suffering for our sin, He trusted Himself to You to raise Him to life again. We know that we are not perfect as He was, for we stumble often. And we thank You that You see us in Jesus, so that we do not fall completely, but You uphold us with Your hand, as Your Word declares.  We thank You that You are the God Who can be trusted.

### The World & The Church
We pray for a world that still needs to know where to find both Justice and Mercy, and grace in time of need. We thank You that You continue to work in the world to win people back to Yourself. It can be easy to become discouraged by the bad things we see so often, but we thank You that the Holy Spirit works quietly, witnessing to the Cross and the Resurrection. Help us to renew our endeavours and work in co-operation with You to bring hope andencouragement in place of despair, and the light of the Gospel in place of darkness and perplexity, to those we meet. 

### Ashburton
We thank You for what You are doing here in Ashburton. Each day, each week, we take steps towards fulfilling Your calling to us as a part of the Body of Christ. We acknoweledge that we are prone to stumble, but we trust You to uphold us so that we do not fail.

We thank You for our ESL classes, for the new students who enrol each week, and we continue to pray for more of our previous students to return. We pray also for the resumption of the Easy English Bible Study and Community group. May they be means of grace to us for fellowship, knowledge of Your Word and growth in becoming more like Jesus every day.

We thank You for everyone who is here, and we remember again those who can't be with us: we bring before You Jim Gleeson and Diane, for Eric, Michael, Nola and Manfred.

We also give thanks for the excellent medical care we have here, and pray again for Peter Jelliff and his follow-up surgery to repair his eyes.

We pray particularly for Les as he faces hip replacement surgery on Tuesday. Guide the surgeons in the use of their skills as they operate. Grant him peace Lord as he takes time away from his busy schedule both for the surgery and the recovery afterwards. 

In all these our prayers Lord, we are concerned less for ourselves and more for others, as we see that Jesus came to serve and not to be served. May all that we do and say be to His honour and glory, Amen.

And now I will ask Sandra to bring us today's reading from Matthew.
