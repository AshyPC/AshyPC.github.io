# Prayers for our church and the world

## 25 Dec 2016 

__Isaiah 53:6__ _We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all._

Let us pray:

### Thanks to God
O Lord, we thank You that we are free to gather and celebrate the first arrival of Your Chosen One. Isaiah declared our impossible situation clearly, and at just the right time You intervened in history. 

We thank You that Jesus' coming was for this one purpose - the greatest rescue mission ever, to save us from Adam's sin. We thank You that You made the first move, reaching out to us, when we were still rebellious in our hearts, and dead to spiritual things. 

### The World & The Church
As we close this year, we recognise that this world is still in great turmoil, and there are many enemies of Your people seeking to undermine Your church. We thank You that we have Your sure promise that the powers of hell will never overcome Your Church.

We pray for the peace of Jerusalem, the City of the Great King, the focus of the first covenant, and for Your Chosen people, greatly persecuted still. We pray for believers suffering persecution in many parts of the world, and thank You for the work of Barnabus Fund, Tear Australia and others working in refugee camps in relief and rescue missions.

We thank You that alongside these practical works, You have entrusted to Your Church the message of reconciliation, to bring to the world the same Good News which the angels gave to the shepherds.

### Ashburton
We thank You that our part in that task is advancing steadily, and we thank You for the decision of the MDC to support our plans for the coming year. We pray for the next stage as we prepare to convert plans into actions. We ask for Your wisdom for the Session and the Board as they finalise terms and we prepare to receive Mook & Ashleigh and others in this new step of faith. We pray for the courage and grace to make the necessary cultural adjustments, as we have done already with our ESL program.

In all these things we remember that You enable us to do Your will, and You provide for us in every way necessary through Jesus, so it is in His Great Name we pray, Amen.

And now I will ask Gaye McKenzie to bring the next reading, which will be from John's gospel.
