R>>Hmm, interesting. I see that point, but it's in conflict with the

R>>1) Pulpit in the same corner as the door. EXTREMELY uncomfortable for

R>>2) Pulpit diagonally opposite the door as per the photos. Gives you
R>>the distance problem.
R>>3) Pulpit to the left of the door
R>>4) Pulpit to the right of the door. These two are pretty similar. You
R>>get some of the awkwardness of #1 and some of the awkwardness of #2,
R>>but not all of either.
R>>
R>>I'm not sure that we'd really gain much by orienting things
R>>differently, and it disrupts the primary line (those of you who
R>>watched me demo this with the model know what I mean). But if another
R>>option is wanted, I'd look at #3, giving a short side between pulpit
R>>and door.


S>Another
S>issue is that a small stage makes it look like a one-man show. I think
S>the musos *should* be up the front, not to perform to the
S>congregation, but because they are actually _ineffective_ at leading
S>from the back. Musical backing only helps if everyone is already
S>singing. Musical _leading_ encourages people to sing (as long as it's
S>done right - keep them at the same level, not on a stage).

R>>Also interesting. To be honest, our current church structure *is* a
R>>one-man show (one at a time; when someone steps up, another steps
R>>down), apart from communion. If you want to propose some up-front
R>>singers, do so, but IMO that should be an independent consideration.
R>>
R>>How much more space would it need?

R>Yeah, buses have some seats facing each other, but you may notice that
R>this doesn't happen above the engine. The point isn't to be sociable -
R>the point is to make room for wheelchairs. (Yes, there are a small
R>number of buses that have bench seats over the engine, but none of the
R>newest ones do, AFAIK. It appears to have been an experiment that got
R>dropped.) Trams and trains have sections that face each other, but
R>they go bidirectionally, and it's as much that the seats are
R>back-to-back as face-to-face. Trams also have the wide section where
R>the only "seating" is longitudinal [1], but again, the point isn't to
R>be sociable, it's to allow more standing room. None of this applies to
R>a church seating arrangement (except maybe the wheelchair spots).

S>You watch what happens when kids from school get on PT. The ones who

S>other, and if they have to go to bench seats, it becomes harder for
S>them to keep conversations with more than three people. The point may
S>be for wheelchairs, but the social benefits do exist.

R>>TBH I try to avoid travelling on buses at school leaving time, so I
R>>don't see that  But I do see plenty of people holding conversations
R>>up the back section, which is where I tend to sit. And yes, 3-4 person
R>>conversations do happen. (Though church isn't normally about
R>>conversations between people in pews, so I'm still not sure how
R>>closely this correlates to a feeling of informality and whatever else
R>>it is we're trying to accomplish.)

>See also Tom Peters "Perception IS reality".

R>So what IS the perception? I guess my "reality" right now is that
R>we're arguing about some changes that are somehow utterly critical,
R>yet nobody can pin down why, even when asked. "Change for change's
R>sake" seems to be the only point anyone can give, and never has there

R>that "different" was good, that "change" was constructive, and if you
R>know why he was trying to brainwash Alice into accepting change for
R>its own sake, you'll see why I revile against it. Different denotes
R>neither bad nor good.

S>Just because Bumby said it doesn't mean it's not true. Though you are
S>right in this case in that change is not always good or constructive,
S>be careful of using that line of argument.

R>>I agree, but I used that example because of how insidious his stance
R>>was - and you can look at cult leaders for similar statements, too.
R>>Start with something that's not really falsifiable, justify everything
R>>with nothing more than "I think this is better", and go to town. Why
R>>do you think I keep asking for solid justification? Why am I bothered
R>>by the utter lack of it?


S>You should know of all people here that some people can immediately
S>and intuitively see that some changes can help even though it takes a
S>lot of analysis to figure out why. Surely this must happen to you
S>while coding all the time.

R>>"""From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my

R>>the correct response is to trot out the actual reasons.

R>And if "change for change's sake" is your justification, you're not

R>They don't see change. They just see state. The goal is to attract and

R>another does. Go ahead. I'll wait.

S>The point isn't to show you change. It's to show other people Christ.

R>>It is if you're proposing a change.

S>With that out of the way...
S>I think it's pretty clear that something isn't working. If we need to

R>>No, it doesn't mean we resist every change. But we do need to be able

R>>
R>>Here's a counter-proposal. I think that we should repaint the church

R>>And I can show you plenty of very successful things that are blue -
R>>butterflies, Neptune, and Dory - so it's clearly worth doing.
R>>
R>>Why aren't you getting out the paint cans already?
R>>


R>> (Or aren't learning from the sermon, or are discouraged from getting
R>> involved, or whatever other criterion you like.)

S>A lot of these changes are about how the church looks to those
S>visiting for the first time. When they see people sitting so far back
S>from the lectern, the natural conclusion is that people are sitting
S>back and letting the minister do everything. This leads on to the idea
S>that church is nothing more than a show every week, whereas we want to
S>look like a body of changed people.

R>>Okay, that sounds well and good. Now demonstrate that the current
R>>system of ranked pews can be improved upon. The sermon structure is
R>>*itself* going to drive this - there really IS one broadcaster up the
R>>front and a whole lot of receivers. You want to encourage
R>>participation? You'll need to create an environment in which people
R>>ctually *SPEAK UP* in the middle of the sermon. Nothing you do to the
R>>seating will change that.

R>>(Clarification) Will change that *on its own*, I mean.

S>Though perhaps the raised dais creates a greater disconnection than
S>the current seating plan. The problem is that we can't just remove the
S>dais without making it difficult for anyone to see the speaker... or
S>can we? Perhaps that would bring people to the front where they can
S>see, thus bringing back the connection that we are attempting to
S>restore.

R>>IMO any dais-free layout is going to be limited by the presence of
R>>tall people in the congregation blocking those behind them. There's
R>>only so much you can do to stagger the seats. Barry's plan still
R>>includes a dais IIRC (albeit a smaller one, which we'd probably call a
R>>podium). Elevating the current speaker to the stage is a good thing.
