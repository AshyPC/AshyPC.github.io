# Prayers for our church and the world
### 4 Dec 2016
__Micah 2:7__ _Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright?_
Let us pray:
## Thanks to God
O Lord, we come into Your presence today, to give You thanks and praise Your Name. The very fact that we are able to speak is a gift from You, as is the gift of grace freely given so that we can come to You. You spoke this world into existence, and all Your creation was very good. But with words the enemy deceived Adam and Eve, and they sinned with words and deeds.
We thank You that You sent Jesus the Living Word to become our substitute, taking the punishment due to us and dealing with our sin completely. We thank You that You see us as upright because of His perfect obedience, and we know that Your words do us good because of that. With Simon Peter, we can only say "to whom could we turn, since You have the words of eternal life?".
## The World & The Church
When we come to pray for our world, we see that words are used for good and for ill. We pray for a world which places too much importance on words like justice and compassion but fails to act justly. We give thanks for the refugee work of Barnabas Fund and pray for their safety as they work to bring compassion to refugee camps. We pray for our nation where some take great offence at words so that others are silenced because they do not know if they are safe to speak their minds. We pray that we might continue to be free to speak the Truth, with respect, within this State which in many ways is growing more and more hostile to the Christian voice. We thank You that there are still people who will listen, and we pray that they respond to the Good News.
## Ashburton
Lord, we thank You that we receive Your Word here through Barry's preaching and teaching. We pray that it will do us good as we grow in sanctification under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. And we pray that the words we use will carry their full weight of meaning, as we speak with friends, family, neighbours and workmates. Help us to put actions to our words so that they see the love that we have for them flows from the love You have for us.
We continue to pray for the plans to bring a cross-cultural worker to join us here. We pray for workers to join us here in this harvest, as we aim to serve those who come into this community.
As we look outward to the work still to be done, we do not forget those within our fellowship, and continue to pray for Jim in rehab, and thank You for the accelerated treatment for Margaret Sanders' foot. May it lead to rapid improvement and complete healing.
All these matters we bring before You in Jesus Precious Name, Amen.
And now we will come to the first part of today's reading from Matthew 17.
