## Centenary of a Tobruk Veteran 

On Sunday August 7th 2016, we held a celebration to honour Eric Edwards, foundation member of the congregation, and a Seven Div veteran of Tobruk.

Eric was featured in the local press, as a special centenarian: a bloke!

The fact is, the ladies outlast the men in thei later years, so there are a lot more women who achieve the milestone than gents.

Eric's wife Wilma passed on in 1985, but he has managed very well on his own since, and duly received a telegram from Her Majesty, along with a vist from the Mayor of Boroondara and the local MP's office.

And here's a post from our Facebook page, put there by a former member and current friend of the congregation:
