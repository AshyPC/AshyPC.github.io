## Thank you for visiting

We hope this website helps you feel as though you are beginning to know us. We would also love to meet you and get to know you. Whether you are a long-time Christian, a new follower of Jesus or simply interested in finding out more about Him, you are very welcome to join us at our Sunday gathering or during the week in our community groups.

We are a group of people who love Jesus, enjoy learning from His word (the Bible), seek to live in obedience to it, and are keen to share with others the relationship we have with Jesus, our Saviour.

We are simply a small part of Jesus' bigger church (the family of people who belong to Him), yet we believe the local church is important expression of His bigger church. He loves it, cares for it and builds it.

You don't have to be a Presbyterian to join with us, or even be certain about what you believe. Whether you are already a follower of Jesus or you are simply interested in finding out more about Him, you are very welcome to come and learn about the difference Jesus makes to life.

We would love to meet you, whether you are looking for a new church family, are on holiday, or simply wanting to find out more about the relevance of Jesus.

### What to expect...
When you come to our <b>Sunday gathering</b> you will find that:

- we sing songs of praise (a mix of contemporary songs and older hymns);
- we talk to God in prayer;
- we read God's word in the Bible and listen to a Bible talk (understanding that God speaks through His word, engaging our minds, hearts and wills).
- on the first Sunday of each month (except January) we remember Jesus' death and resurrection as we celebrate the Lord's Supper (Communion) together.

We believe that church is for everyone, so we also seek to include children. Our church is wheelchair and pram friendly. You will find extra space for families with young kids and there is a cry-room facility (where you can still see and hear what is happening), should you need it.

After our Sunday gathering has finished we spend some time together for a cuppa and chat.
We try to keep formalities to a minimum (avoiding jargon), and most people simply dress "neat casual". We also seek to avoid emotional hype or acting like we're perfect or we've got everything together - we're simply ordinary people who love and follow Jesus.

At present we do not have a regular Sunday evening meeting, but we periodically gather for a special time to talk to God in prayer on Sundays afternoons at 5pm.
